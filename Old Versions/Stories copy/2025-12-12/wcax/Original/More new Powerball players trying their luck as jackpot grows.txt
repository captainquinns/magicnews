BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - A whopping one billion dollars is at stake as the Powerball jackpot grows with no winner, drawing more players out of the woodwork for a chance to strike it big.

At the Champlain farms on Shelburne Road in Burlington, staff say it’s more than just their regulars coming to play.

“During Powerball jackpot explosion, yeah, you see foot traffic increase. You see people buying $20 wacks at a time. It gets interesting, it’s a whole different crowd,” said staff member Daniel Magistrale.

While some Vermont Powerball ticket sellers don’t accept debit cards, Champlain Farms takes cash and debit. “They get very excited about that, and I feel like that’s won a lot of people over to give them a reason to come here instead of a lot of the other gas stations,” Magistrale said.

After taxes, in a lump sum payment, winners would take home roughly $461 million.

The next drawing is Saturday night.
