BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - A Vermont man charged in a double murder that could face the death penalty has pleaded not guilty.

Theodore Bland, who appeared in federal court Thursday, is accused of killing two Massachusetts men in October 2023 and dumping their bodies in the woods in Eden. Police say Bland shot both men and that everyone involved was part of a drug-dealing ring.

A new indictment unveiled last month against Bland updates the murder charges and sets the stage for the feds seeking the death penalty.

Bland is being held behind bars.
