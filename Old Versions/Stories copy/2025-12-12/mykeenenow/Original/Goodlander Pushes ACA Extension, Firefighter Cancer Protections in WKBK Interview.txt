Maggie Goodlander told WKBK she’s pushing bipartisan bills on healthcare costs, firefighter cancer benefits and transparency on military action.

KEENE, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Congresswoman Maggie Goodlander used her Friday appearance on WKBK’s Good Morning with Dan Mitchell to press forward several key priorities — extending Affordable Care Act tax credits, securing firefighter cancer protections, and demanding legal clarity for any potential military action in Venezuela.

Mitchell welcomed Goodlander to the program with holiday greetings before turning quickly to the looming year-end deadline for ACA tax credits. Both Republican and Democratic Senate bills to extend the subsidies failed this week, leaving New Hampshire families and hospitals increasingly anxious.

Goodlander said extending the credits remains her top legislative priority.

“We need to pass the bipartisan healthcare.gov tax credit extension immediately,” she said. “If we don’t, families will see devastating cost spikes and our hospitals could enter a dangerous death spiral.” She added that House members from both parties — even ideologically distant lawmakers — support the extension, but House leadership has not yet agreed to bring it to the floor.

Goodlander highlighted that the action item in front of Congress is clear: pass the bipartisan legislation that extends the healthcare.gov tax credits and tackles rising healthcare costs. She noted ongoing bipartisan efforts to reform pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) as part of that broader push.

The interview then turned to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and a measure Goodlander has championed since entering Congress: the Honoring Our Fallen Heroes Act, which would recognize cancer as a line-of-duty death for firefighters. The provision passed the House this week as part of the FY 2026 NDAA.

“Firefighters put everything on the line for us, and cancer is now their number-one killer,” she said. “My job isn’t done until this is signed into law.”

Goodlander said the next action item for her office is pushing the bill through the Senate — a step she called “absolutely essential” so that firefighter families finally receive the federal benefits they’ve long been denied.

Mitchell then pressed Goodlander about the President’s shifting stance on releasing a video of a controversial double-tap strike off the coast of Venezuela. Goodlander said a provision in the NDAA requires the Secretary of Defense to make the footage public, calling transparency “non-negotiable.”

When asked whether U.S. troops may soon be deployed to Venezuela, Goodlander said Congress must assert its constitutional war-powers role. “The President needs to present a clear justification and a legal basis for any military action,” she said. “That is an action item Congress cannot ignore.” She questioned the administration’s strategic rationale so far and urged a more responsible and transparent approach before any escalation occurs.

The conversation briefly turned to a bipartisan video Goodlander joined, reminding military personnel they are not obligated to follow illegal orders. She said the video simply reinforces the oath to the Constitution — but the political response has been volatile.

Goodlander confirmed her Concord office recently received a bomb threat, which she attributed to inflammatory statements from the President. “Serving in public trust has never been risk-free,” she said. “But the level of threats today is deeply concerning and demands more responsible leadership.”

Before closing the interview, Mitchell invited Goodlander to offer a message to her constituents. She acknowledged the economic pressure facing families but said she remains focused on practical results over political theater.

“I’m working around the clock to deliver for New Hampshire,” she said. “My focus is on the work that actually works — lowering costs, protecting families, and ensuring transparency in every corner of federal government.”

Mitchell ended the interview with warm holiday wishes, thanking the congresswoman for joining the program.
