**Weekend Food Drive in New Hampshire Supports Families in Need**

The Spirit of Giving Food Drive commenced on Friday, December 12, and will run throughout the weekend, aiming to assist families facing food insecurity in New Hampshire. While shopping at Hannaford, Shaw's, or Walmart in the state from December 12-14, shoppers can find special displays designated for this initiative.

In addition to donating food, individuals can contribute financially to the New Hampshire Food Bank. A significant opportunity has been announced: a private funder will match all contributions up to a total of $125,000, which will enhance efforts to secure additional resources for local communities. 

The executive director of the New Hampshire Food Bank noted that this matching grant will facilitate greater fundraising efforts to support those in need. Reports indicate that every $1.28 received helps the Food Bank deliver about two meals to hungry individuals.

Current statistics reveal that about 10% of residents in the state, including 14% of children, experience food insecurity, which means they lack reliable access to healthy food options. The campaign involves all Hannaford, Shaws, and Walmart locations in New Hampshire, with monetary contributions also accepted online at NHFoodBank.org.

Over the past few years, the New Hampshire Food Bank has had a significant impact on food distribution. In 2021, it provided over 17 million pounds of food equivalent to more than 14.5 million meals. In 2022, this number was over 16 million pounds, translating to around 13.7 million meals. By 2023, it managed to distribute a similar volume, yielding approximately 13.6 million meals.

The Food Bank works with over 400 partner organizations throughout the state, including food pantries, shelters, soup kitchens, child programs, and senior centers, supplying approximately 60% of the food that these groups provide. For those in need of food assistance, a directory of resources is available at https://nhfoodbank.org/find-food/food-map/.
