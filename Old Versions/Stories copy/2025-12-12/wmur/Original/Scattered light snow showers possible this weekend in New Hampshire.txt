Snow showers are possible each day this weekend in New Hampshire, but no significant travel impacts are expected.

Ahead of the weekend, Granite Staters are facing cold and windy conditions. Friday will be sunny and brisk, as winds will gust to 30 mph.

Highs on Friday will be in the 20s up north to the 30s for southern zones. Wind chills are in the single digits to start the day and the teens for the afternoon.

The winds eventually die off Friday night, as lows drop into the teens in most spots.

Saturday features sun to start before clouds fill in. Highs will be in the 30s.

There's a chance for afternoon and evening snow showers, though it's likely to fall lightly and not affect travel conditions on what will be a busy shopping weekend.

There should be partial sunshine for some, but there is a chance of light snow on Sunday as a weak system passes to the south of New Hampshire.

Highs will top out in the upper 20s for most areas.

Bitterly cold air returns for Monday, as the day will begin with lows in the single digits and teens and highs will top out in the low 20s.

After that, it looks as if the Granite State will slowly warm up through the middle of next week.
