Our Spirit of Giving Food Drive to support the New Hampshire Food Bank kicked off Friday, Dec. 12, and will continue all weekend long.

When you are grocery shopping the weekend of Dec. 12-14, just look for the Spirit of Giving display at any Hannaford, Shaw's or Walmart store in New Hampshire.

Donors can also donate money to the New Hampshire Food Bank .

JUST ANNOUNCED: An anonymous donor has agreed to match any donations up to $125,000.

“We received a matching grant of $125,000 from an anonymous donor, which is going to allow us to raise even more funding for our community,” Elsy Cipriani, executive director of the New Hampshire Food Bank, said.

For every $1.28 donated, the New Hampshire Food Bank can provide approximately two meals.

According to recent data, approximately 1 in 10 people, including 1 in 7 children, in New Hampshire face food insecurity, meaning they do not have consistent access to nutritious foods.

All Hannaford, Shaw’s and Walmart stores in New Hampshire are participating. Monetary donations can be made at NHFoodBank.org .
