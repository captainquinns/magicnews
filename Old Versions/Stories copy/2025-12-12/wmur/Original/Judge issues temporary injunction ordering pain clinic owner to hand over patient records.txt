A judge has ordered the owner of a New Hampshire pain care clinic to turn over medical records to former patients.

The state is suing Matthew Hogan and several of his medical companies after his clinic abruptly closed last month, leaving patients without access to their information.

Some of his companies include PMC Medical Group, Salmon Falls Health Care and Curam Health.

The Attorney General's Office said it has received more than 30 complaints about Hogan and his businesses since the summer.

Neither Hogan nor his attorney appeared in court Thursday.

The judge granted the state's request for a temporary injunction requiring the records to be released.
