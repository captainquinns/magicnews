Granite Staters have a chance to see the one of the most anticipated meteor showers of the year this weekend.

The Geminid meteor shower peaks this weekend.

The Geminids are well-known for their bright and frequent fireballs.

Skywatchers could see up to 120 of them each hour.

The best time to view the show is between midnight and dawn. Some meteors might be visible as early as 9 p.m.

The best way to view the meteors is to find somewhere away from city lights and give your eyes about 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness.
