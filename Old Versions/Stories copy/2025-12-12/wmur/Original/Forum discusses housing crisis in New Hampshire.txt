Organizers of a housing forum at Saint Anselm College said Friday that the housing shortage is the most critical issue the New Hampshire economy is facing.

Speakers at the annual Housing We Need Forum said the issue of housing needs constant attention.

The agenda focused on innovative housing development models using zoning updates, community advocacy, the latest research and more. Organizers said housing is the most important component to a thriving community.

Manchester Mayor Jay Ruais said New Hampshire is projected to be 60,000 units short by 2030, and state Sen. Keith Murphy, R-Manchester, said that over the past four years, the housing crisis has increased by 59%.

Michael Skelton, CEO of the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire, said housing is the most important issue facing the future of the state's economy.

"Demand is really high, and we haven't kept up with demand," Skelton said. "We've dug ourselves a big hole, so the challenge is pretty stark. But where I see us going is that we're recognizing that growth is the future for New Hampshire. If we want to be a vibrant, healthy, economically competitive state, we have to embrace growth. That means building more housing of all types."

Skelton said the forum is just a step, and everyone plays a part in a better future. He encouraged community members to speak out more on making housing a priority.
