MONTPELIER, Vt. (WCAX) - A judge denied the Vermont State Employees Association’s petition to get a preliminary injunction to halt Gov. Scott’s return-to-office mandate.

VSEA argued the mandate is rushed, will upend the lives of employees living out of state, and will cost taxpayers more.

The court says the union did not show evidence of irreparable harm in their filing.

This means most state employees will have to report to the office three days a week beginning Monday, Dec. 1.

The Scott administration contended they have the authority to bring employees back, and having more public-facing positions will provide better service for Vermonters.

The state also says it will make exceptions for some employees if they have long commutes or child care issues.

About 3,000 employees work remotely. The state has received 425 exception requests. Officials say 25 have been approved and 400 are still under review.
