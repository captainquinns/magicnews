BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Burlington’s winter market returned Saturday with a new indoor format and select dates, marking a change from previous years.

The winter market took place at the Burlington City Arts Pine Street location for its first event of the season. The market drew a good turnout with attendees browsing stands from local vendors.

The next two market dates are scheduled for December 12 and 13 in the Cantois Auditorium in City Hall.

Lee Cook of Pennsylvania attended Saturday’s market and sampled local beer. “I don’t do crafts myself but it’s nice to see the beer and we got some of that,” Cook said. “Real good, my son recommended it.”

Organizers said some of the same vendors will return in December along with new ones for those who missed Saturday’s event.
