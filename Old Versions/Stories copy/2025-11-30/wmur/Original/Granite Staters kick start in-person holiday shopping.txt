With Christmas just a little more than a month away, plenty of families spent their Sunday trying to cross a few names off the list and getting back to in-person shopping.

"There's something to be said for coming in person and the community aspect of it," said Kathleen Williamson of Andover, Massachusetts.

Shoppers at Tuscan Village said they love the atmosphere and the reliability. At a time when online items can be delayed, out of stock or not quite what you expected.

"Honestly, I feel like sometimes you have better luck getting what you are looking for cause sometimes when I find you're shopping online, you can't get the styles or sizes or colors you want," Williamson said.

"You find things you wouldn't find online," said Jeff Devito of Arlington, Massachusetts. "The algorithm just puts what's popular in front of you, but here it becomes more personable."

One pop-up vendor here at Tuscan Village is finding so much success with people shopping in person that it's moving to a traditional brick-and-mortar storefront.

"This has been my side hustle and my dream for my whole life," said Maria Devito Palmer, small business owner.

Devito Palmer says she's experiencing more and more shoppers looking for gifts that feel more meaningful.

"Like people are just looking for things that are not on your screen," said Devito Palmer.

For her, that personal connection is what keeps her coming back each holiday season, and she hopes that as December approaches, it'll be another big year for in-person buying.
