Santa and some special elves made early Christmas runs Monday for the 12th annual Tactical Christmas in Nashua.

At a Whole Foods in Nashua, Santa's sleigh was filled with food for families in need.

"It's a partnership between the schools, the police department, the SWAT team and, of course, the Police Athletic League, identifying kids in need and families in need to help serve them during the critical time of year," said PAL Officer Bennett Stusse.

"Some of these people can't afford a meal, so providing them with a meal and happiness one day is a great, great thing for us to do for them," said Police Chief Kevin Rourke. "It's a chance for us to give back to the community."

Santa rode in the SWAT team's tactical vehicle to deliver food and gifts to more than 50 Nashua families.

The first drop-off was to Karelys Alvarado and her family.

"It has been very helpful, because it was scary losing everything in the fire," she said.

Alvarado's home burned down in a massive fire earlier this month. She said her family was grateful for the donations.

"We've been, how do you say it? Overwhelmed," she said.

Organizers said the work doesn't end with Monday's drop-offs, and they could use more help. Unwrapped gifts and gift cards can be donated at locations across Nashua.

"We can't do this all by ourselves," Rourke said. "Doing this with other people and partnerships is the best way to go, because we can give more to more families."

Alvarado said she wanted to encourage anyone who needs assistance during the holidays to reach out, reminding them that they're not alone.
