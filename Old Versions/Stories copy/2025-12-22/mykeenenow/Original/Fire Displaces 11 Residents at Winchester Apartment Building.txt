Firefighters from Winchester and surrounding communities battled a Friday afternoon structure fire at a four-unit apartment building on Back Ashuelot Road, displacing 11 residents but causing no injuries.

WINCHESTER, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Firefighters from Winchester and several neighboring towns put out a fire Friday afternoon at an apartment building on Back Ashuelot Road, stopping it before it could spread through the entire structure.

Crews were called to 391 Back Ashuelot Road shortly after 1:30 p.m. on Dec. 19 after residents reported smoke alarms sounding and smoke inside the building. Emergency responders arriving at the scene saw smoke coming from the front of the building, and everyone inside had already gotten out safely.

As the situation became clearer, fire officials requested additional help from nearby communities. Firefighters from Hinsdale, Swanzey, Northfield, Mass., and Warwick, Mass., joined Winchester crews at the scene. In total, more than 30 firefighters responded.

The fire broke out inside a four-unit apartment building with three floors. Firefighters traced the flames to a hidden space behind walls and inside a closet, where the fire was able to move upward between floors. Crews quickly worked to open up walls and knock down the fire before it reached the top floor.

While firefighters attacked the flames, other crews checked each apartment to confirm that no one was trapped inside. The fire was brought under control about an hour after the first call, and no injuries were reported.

Winchester Police, Winchester Ambulance and Eversource were also on scene to assist. The American Red Cross was contacted to help 11 residents who were displaced and needed temporary housing.

Fire officials said the fire appears to have started near electrical equipment inside the building. The cause remains under investigation.
