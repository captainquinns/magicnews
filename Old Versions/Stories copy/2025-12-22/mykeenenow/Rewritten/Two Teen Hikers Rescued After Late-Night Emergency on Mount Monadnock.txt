**Two Teens Rescued from Mount Monadnock After Cold Night Stranded Without Gear**

Emergency services were dispatched to Mount Monadnock following an incident involving two teenage hikers who became stuck during the night due to extreme cold and inadequate equipment. The event occurred late last week.

The teenagers, residents of Winchendon, Massachusetts, embarked on their hike around 5:30 p.m. on December 19, despite the darkness and lack of proper provisions such as food, water, and sufficient clothing for cold weather. They encountered difficulties, including a fall into a brook, leaving them wet and chilled. State Police were informed of their predicament around 10 p.m. via a distress call that had been routed through dispatch.

New Hampshire Fish and Game representatives reported that harsh winds and plummeting temperatures quickly escalated the situation to an urgent medical crisis. Conservation officers, supported by the Upper Valley Wilderness Response Team volunteers, moved to the mountain's aid.

Rescue teams successfully located the hikers just before 11 p.m. While one of them, Shawn Paelian, managed to walk down the mountain with help, the other, Brendan Girouard, was unable to proceed due to cold-related injuries. Rescuers worked promptly to remove Girouard's soaked and frozen clothing and to warm him on-site. It was also noted that Girouard had a significant level of intoxication during the incident.

After several hours of necessary treatment, Girouard was transported off the mountain and received care from the Jaffrey-Rindge Memorial Ambulance Service around 2 a.m. on December 20, before being transferred to Heywood Hospital in Massachusetts for further evaluation. Following the rescue, Girouard faced charges for minor possession of alcohol, and authorities indicated that they would recommend imposing fees on both hikers for the rescue operation. 

Officials are reminding all outdoor enthusiasts to adequately prepare, bring necessary gear, and adhere to safety guidelines outlined by the Hike Safe program, especially in winter conditions when hiking in New Hampshire.
