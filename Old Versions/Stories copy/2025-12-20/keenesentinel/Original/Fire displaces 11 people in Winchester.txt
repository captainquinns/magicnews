WINCHESTER — A second-alarm fire on Friday afternoon damaged a multi-family home in Back Ashuelot Road, displacing 11 residents, the Winchester Fire Department said.

First responders were called to 391 Back Ashuelot Road just after 1:30 p.m. and found smoke billowing from the side of the building, according to a news release from the Winchester Fire Department.

The wooden building was evacuated and the fire spread fast, according to the news release, which said the blaze began on the second floor at an area that supplied power to the second and third floor electrical panels.

No one was injured and the fire department determined the fire was "electrical in nature," according to the release.

The Winchester Police Department, Winchester Ambulance and Eversource were also on the scene. The Red Cross was notified about the displaced residents, the release said.

Representatives from the Winchester Fire Department were not immediately available for comment Saturday.
