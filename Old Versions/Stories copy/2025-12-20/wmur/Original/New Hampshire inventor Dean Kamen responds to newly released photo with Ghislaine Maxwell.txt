Within the files released Friday by the Department of Justice is another photo of New Hampshire businessman Dean Kamen. It shows Kamen on a Segway with Ghislaine Maxwell. Kamen is known for inventing the Segway.

In documents filed as part of the criminal case against Maxwell, flight logs showed Kamen’s name on a passenger list of Epstein’s private plane in February 2003. It is important to note that Kamen has not been accused of any wrongdoing or crime in connection with Epstein.

Kamen is the founder of DEKA Research and Development. Kamen provided this statement to WMUR:

"I was a speaker at the TED Conference in Monterey, California a number of times, including February 2002 ( https://www.ted.com/talks/dean_kamen_to_invent_is_to_give ). If I had to guess, based in part on helpful reminders from friends, I would say that this photo was taken at that conference (or some similar conference) shortly after the launch of Segway where I gave I rides to many, if not most, of the TED conference attendees.

"Unfortunately, Jeffrey Epstein was a central figure in the TED community for many years. I have no specific memory of this photo or any other interaction with Ghislaine Maxwell and had only limited interactions with Jeffrey Epstein.  I hope that it goes without saying that those interactions in no way involved any wrong-doing and, in hindsight with what I now know, I regret even those limited interactions.  Again, I have no knowledge of any of the horrific actions of Jeffrey Epstein (or Ghislaine Maxwell) other than what I have learned from news reports."

Kamen has not been accused of any wrongdoing related to his time spent with Epstein or Maxwell.
