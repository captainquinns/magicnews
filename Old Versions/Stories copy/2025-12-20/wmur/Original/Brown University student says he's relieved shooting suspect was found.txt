A Brown University student from New Hampshire is home now and reacting to news that the search for the suspect in a mass shooting is over.

Freshman Cameron Piwnicki said he was minutes from heading into the building where the shooting took place.

Speaking from his home in Newfields, Piwnicki said he wished that suspect Claudio Neves Valente had been found alive, mostly because he wants to understand the shooter's motive.

Piwnicki said he had just finished his baseball workout Saturday when he was planning to head into the Barus & Holley building to do some studying. He lingered on his phone for a while before going in and thinks that time could have helped save his life.

Piwnicki said the uncertainty around the manhunt was difficult, and he as then shocked to learn the suspect was found dead at a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, just 45 minutes from his hometown.

While he would like to have a clear understanding of the motive behind the killings, Piwnicki said the resolution offers him peace of mind.

"Knowing he's not out there and is not any active threat, I think that's going to make going back to campus a lot easier for a lot of people, myself included, and overall, it's just better we're able to find out who it was," Piwnicki said.

He said he was deeply grateful for all the people who have reached out to him to check on how he's doing.

He also hopes that Brown University will increase safety measures, such as making sure all buildings require key cards.
