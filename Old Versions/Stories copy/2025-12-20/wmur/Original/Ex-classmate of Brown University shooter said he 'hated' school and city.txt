While a motive remains unclear, we're learning new information about Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, the mass shooter who police suspect opened fire at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and then shot an MIT professor in Brookline, Massachusetts.

Scott Watson said he was a former classmate and friend of Neves Valente during his time at Brown University 25 years ago.

Watson is now a professor at Syracuse University. He said Neves Valente complained that the classes at Brown were too easy and left the program early on.

"He was bored because he knew more than any of us, he already should've had a PhD," Watson said. "He hated Brown and he hated Providence."

Watson said he remembers acclaimed MIT nuclear physicist Nuno F. G. Loureiro visiting Brown University during his time there, though he didn't know if he and Neves Valente were friends.

Neves Valente attended the same academic program in Portugal as Loureiro from 1995 through 2000.

On Dec. 13, Neves Valente shot and killed two Brown University students and injured nine others in the Barus and Holley engineering building, where exams were scheduled, according to officials. The two students killed in the shooting were identified as Ella Cook of Birmingham, Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov.

Two days later, Neves Valente allegedly shot and killed Loureiro before driving up to a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, and shooting himself.

An autopsy report from New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella on Friday confirmed Neves Valente died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head on Tuesday, Dec. 16, days before authorities found him. Neves Valente's manner of death was determined to be suicide.
