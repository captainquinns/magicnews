The weather looks quiet ahead of a busy weekend of travel and holiday shopping.

Saturday will be colder than Sunday, but little precipitation is expected other than possible passing snow showers in northern areas.

On Saturday, there could be some locally strong wind gusts over eastern slopes of the White Mountains. The wind will gradually subside during the day.

During the day, expect fair skies and cooler conditions, with highs in the 30s.

It could be a touch warmer on Sunday, the first day of winter. Expect some clouds and partial sun with a chance of a few spotty mixed or snow showers, mainly north.
