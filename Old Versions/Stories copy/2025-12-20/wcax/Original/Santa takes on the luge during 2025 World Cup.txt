Lake Placid, N.Y. (WCAX) - Santa took a break from toymaking this week and paid a visit to Lake Placid, New York.

While there, he flew down the luge track at Mt Van Hoevenberg’s Olympic Sports Complex.

The site is hosting the 2025 FIL Luge World Cup, which will determine which athletes qualify for the Winter Olympics. Those kick off February 6 in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo Italy.
