PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (WCAX) - After the warm-up this week, you’ll want to use extra caution when ice fishing.

The New York Department of Environmental Conservation wants you to check ice thickness before stepping onto it.

They say you’ll need at least 4 inches of clear, solid ice to be safe.

Plus, be cautious of areas with moving water, and try to avoid areas near boat docks.

Checking thickness with an auger or going out with friends can increase your safety on the ice.

“In the event that you do go through the ice, it’s important to know the direction you came from is safe and hold your weight, so should you fall through, orienting yourself and going back the way that you came is a good thing to remember. On top of that, you’re going to want to get your arms all the way on top of that ice, and then it’s really important to get into a horizontal position,” said DEC forest ranger Ashly Carabetta.

If you want to try ice fishing, mark your calendar for February 14-15. It’s a free freshwater fishing weekend.

Outside of that weekend, you will need a valid fishing license.
