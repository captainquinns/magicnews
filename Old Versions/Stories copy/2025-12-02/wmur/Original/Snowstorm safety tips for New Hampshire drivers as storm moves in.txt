The first snowstorm of the season is expected to cause slippery roadways and bad visibility during the afternoon and evening commutes in New Hampshire.

Officials from the New Hampshire Department of Transportation said drivers should clear all snow and ice off their cars before hitting the road. They also recommend removing any snow around the exhaust pipe to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. It is advised to check tire pressure, windshield wipers, and lights before driving.

When on the road, drivers should give plows plenty of space while they are working and slow down. The snow will likely start to fall very soon, and updates on road conditions will be provided throughout the morning.
