New Hampshire is preparing for a winter storm that could bring up to 10 inches of snow to some areas, with residents and NHDOT crews taking action ahead of the expected snowfall.

Many hardware stores across the state were busy on Monday as people grabbed last-minute supplies, including shovels, snow blowers, and ice melt. Some people advised stocking up on salt ahead of the storm, noting that the first storm of the season often brings mixed emotions.

The New Hampshire Department of Transportation reported that its crews spent much of Monday night preparing plow trucks to hit the roads. Plows are expected to be out all day, salting and sanding the roads for the duration of the storm. Some roads may also be pre-treated depending on how quickly the storm moves in.
