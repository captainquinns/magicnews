Keene ombudsman George Downing tells WKBK he’s working to meet every downtown stakeholder ahead of the city’s two-year rebuild.

KEENE, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Keene’s downtown reconstruction project ombudsman, George Downing, joined Good Morning with Dan Mitchell on WKBK Radio Tuesday to outline how the city plans to stay connected with businesses and residents as it prepares for a massive, two-year reconstruction of the city center beginning in May 2026.

Downing, appointed to serve as the liaison between the city, contractors and the nearly 120 downtown businesses affected by the project, said his priority has been simple: meet as many stakeholders as possible before construction begins to shape a clear picture of concerns, access issues and communication needs.

“I’ve been doing a lightning tour of downtown,” he said, noting that he’s already introduced himself to more than a hundred businesses, with more conversations still ahead for hard-to-reach residential units. Locked buildings and off-site property managers have slowed that effort, he added, but he plans to continue knocking on doors and following up with owners.

Downing told listeners that the city is designing its communication strategy as it goes, relying heavily on social media updates, email blasts and direct contact. Walk-in office hours he held in October drew only a handful of participants, he said, prompting him to refocus on face-to-face outreach at storefronts.

Mitchell pressed for details on how events will be affected during construction—a major concern among downtown organizers. Downing said the city is drafting maps of alternative event spaces to help keep festivals and parades running while crews work. Those maps are still being refined and will be reviewed at an upcoming MSFI committee meeting.

Keene Public Works Director Don Lussier joined the conversation to clarify that Main Street will remain part of event footprints despite the construction. He also outlined the project’s bidding timeline: contractor bids are due Dec. 18, with City Manager Elizabeth Ferland expected to announce the shortlist that evening. The goal, Luce said, is to award a contract within a month and begin staging for construction in the spring.

Both Lussier and Downing stressed that the success of the multiyear overhaul depends on consistent, clear communication—particularly around parking, daily work zones and underground utility upgrades.

Downing encouraged anyone who hasn’t spoken with him directly to reach out. He also urged residents, property owners and business operators to sign up for the city’s downtown construction email updates to stay informed as the project moves toward its 2026 start date.
