BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - The Burlington City Council on Monday night entered into a contract with the Howard Center to fill in the gaps of the BTV Cares mental health crisis program.

The BTV Cares program, the police program that launched in 2024, was funded by a short-term state grant that expires this month. Two positions will be cut as a result.

The city has agreed to pay $249,000 to the Howard Center for taking over the current case load of about 50 people.

It is important to note that this will not be an exact replacement for the program.
