JACKSON, N.H. (WCAX) - Black Mountain is offering free skiing to Jackson, New Hampshire, residents on Tuesday as part of a community celebration following the resort’s legal settlement with the town.

The ski area said it reached a full settlement with Jackson over operations at the mountain. Mountain officials say the agreement clears the way for recent investments in lifts, snowmaking equipment and a new ownership plan.

They’re celebrating with a community powder day on Tuesday.

Jackson residents and season passholders from other mountains that aren’t operating ski free from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. All others can join for $25, but you must register.
