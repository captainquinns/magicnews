State officials are planning to stop collecting cash on the northbound and southbound lanes of the Everett Turnpike at the Bedford toll booths.

The change will begin on Jan. 8 at 10 p.m.

Officials said drivers should adhere to 25 mph speed limits when traveling through the cashless toll lanes.

It is part of a long-term project to remove the toll booths entirely and switch to an all-electronic toll system.

To avoid fees, state officials are encouraging people who normally pay in cash to create E-ZPass accounts.
