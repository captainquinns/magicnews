State LCHIP grants totaling nearly $224,000 will support forest conservation in Nelson and the restoration of Winchester’s historic National Bank building.

CONCORD, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Nearly $0.25 million in state matching grants will flow into the Monadnock Region as part of New Hampshire’s latest round of Land and Community Heritage Investment Program funding, supporting both land conservation in Nelson and the rehabilitation of a historic building in Winchester.

The awards are part of LCHIP’s annual grant cycle, which directs state funds to projects that protect natural landscapes and preserve historic resources across New Hampshire. This year, the program approved $3.5 million for 31 projects statewide.

The largest local award — $200,000 — was granted to the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests for its Nelson Highlands Forest project, according to a news release. The funding will help conserve 655 acres of high-elevation spruce forest, preserving wildlife habitat while maintaining opportunities for public recreation such as hiking, hunting, and wildlife observation.

Once protected, the Nelson Highlands Forest will connect more than 5,800 acres of already conserved land, strengthening a continuous corridor within the Harris Center SuperSanctuary and the Quabbin-to-Cardigan conservation region. LCHIP officials said the project will bolster biodiversity and protect a landscape considered critical for long-term ecological resilience.

Winchester will also benefit from the latest round of grants, receiving about $24,000 to support repairs to the former Winchester National Bank building on the town green. The Greek Revival-style structure, built in 1847, served as the town’s primary banking institution for roughly 150 years before closing in 1997.

The town acquired the building last year through a private donation and plans to convert it into a community and multipurpose center. The LCHIP grant will assist with exterior work, including drainage improvements, masonry repairs, and restoration of historic woodwork. Local volunteers raised the required matching funds through the town’s National Bank Common Committee.

The bank building was added to the New Hampshire State Register of Historic Places in August, and construction is expected to begin next year.

State officials said the Winchester project will help stabilize the structure while laying the groundwork for future programming, events, and heritage tourism that could bring additional visitors to the downtown area.

Since its creation in 2000, LCHIP has awarded more than $68 million in matching grants statewide, leveraging additional public and private investment to conserve land and restore historic landmarks throughout New Hampshire.
