BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Vermont’s attorney general is suing the Trump administration for cutting grants to electric vehicle charging stations.

Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark joined a coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia in filing a lawsuit on Tuesday for what they say is the unlawful withholding of more than $2 billion in funding for two electric vehicle charging programs.

They say the U.S. Department of Transportation has quietly refused to approve any new funding under two electric vehicle charging infrastructure programs.

The coalition alleges this violates the constitutional separation of powers, as funding was approved by bipartisan majorities in Congress.

The lawsuit filed in Seattle is the latest legal battle over funding for EV charging infrastructure that states say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”
