New Hampshire Fish and Game is urging people to be prepared for the weather when going out for a hike this winter.

Friday night, rescue crews were called to Mount Monadnock in Jaffrey for two people who had fallen into a brook while hiking in cold, windy conditions.

Officials say the hikers had no food, water, warm clothes or any cold-weather gear.

The hikers were helped off the trail and treated for cold-weather injuries.
