According to the New Hampshire Lottery, a store in Derry sold a $1 million winner for Saturday night's drawing.

The ticket was bought at the Common Man Roadside.

The winning numbers for Saturday's drawing were 4, 5, 28, 52 and 69, with the Powerball number of 20. The player matched all five numbers, but not the Powerball number, to win the prize.

Across the country, there were seven other $1 million winners - one in California, one in Florida, one in Iowa, one in Massachusetts, two in Michigan and one in Ohio.

There was no jackpot winner, so the big prize for Monday's drawing is now an estimated $1.6 billion.

Monday’s jackpot ranks as the fourth largest in Powerball history and the fifth largest among U.S. lottery jackpots.
