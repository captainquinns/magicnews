In the wake of the Brown University shooting, parents and future students are worried about safety when it comes to attending school.

School shootings have gone up sharply in recent years. That's according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.

News 9 spoke with a clinical psychologist about how this might have an impact on college-age students looking to attend school.

"Especially high schoolers, juniors and seniors who are thinking ahead. 'Tis the season to be filling out their essays and turning in all their applications or thinking about it," said Dr. Laura Landerman-Garber, clinical psychologist. "What that means in terms of their own safety, I would like parents to take a look at their kids maybe a little bit -- maybe opening their eyes a little bit wider, even though we are in the midst of such fun holiday stuff, I think we want to see if they're functioning okay."

Dr. Landerman-Garber also says that it's good to ask questions about how students may view or process news like the Brown shooting.
