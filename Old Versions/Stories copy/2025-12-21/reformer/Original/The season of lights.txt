Lights shine bright at Eric Clark's home in Westminster as he adds to his display.

WESTMINSTER – As winter solstice marks the longest night of the year — and the official beginning of winter — the skies of the surrounding area glow with the twinkle of Christmas lights for the holiday season.

While some put up a string of lights or maybe an old blow mold that has been passed down over the years, Eric Clark creates a mixture of static figures and a tasteful light display.

Off a dead-end street in Westminster, on Sunny Meadow Drive, Clark built his home, and over the years he has kept growing his display of lights.

“I got into doing lights because we had kids and we lived in a small house in town,” said Clark. “I started decorating our other house. And through the years, it just kept on getting bigger and bigger, just never satisfied with what you got. I'm never 100% done.”

He added that he doesn’t advertise his display because it's mostly to see his family's reaction when they see it. It helps him to get out of the house and gets him in the Christmas spirit.

Clark reminisced about a friend who recently died, Rodney Stone, who would create elaborate displays in Bellows Falls.

“I like it when people put lights up. (Stone) had a house on the bottom of Kissell Hill, and he made it look like a gingerbread house,” said Clark. “He had lights over every square inch of it.”

As Christmas approaches, Clark is still adding to his display.

“I'm hoping to get a couple more things done. I've got stuff I ordered that I haven't gotten yet, but I'm hoping by next week I’ll have everything up."

It takes him roughly a month to construct his display, always tweaking the design, but after the holidays he likes to get them down quickly before the snow piles up.
