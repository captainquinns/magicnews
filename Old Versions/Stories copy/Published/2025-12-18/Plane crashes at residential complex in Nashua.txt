Title: Small Aircraft Crashes in Nashua Neighborhood

A small aircraft went down on Wednesday afternoon in a residential area of Nashua. The incident took place at a complex located near Cannongate Road, just across Route 101A from Nashua Airport.

The crash occurred around 2:15 p.m., with fire officials confirming that the pilot was the only occupant of the aircraft. The plane made contact with a house's roof before landing upside down close to a parking lot.

According to reports from Fire Chief Steve Buxton, bystanders assisted the pilot in exiting the plane. He was subsequently transported to a hospital, where details regarding his injuries remained unclear. Fortunately, no other individuals were injured during the incident.

Buxton suggested that the pilot may have been conducting takeoff and landing practices at the airport prior to the crash. Witness James Fogarty, who aided in rescuing the pilot, observed the plane experiencing mechanical issues just before the crash. He reported that the engine was sputtering, and after he reached the scene, the plane struck the building and flipped.

The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to begin their investigation at the site shortly.
