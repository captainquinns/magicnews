One Fatality Reported in I-89 Collision Involving Wrong-Way Driver

A tragic multi-vehicle crash occurred on Interstate 89 in Richmond, resulting in one death. The incident, which included a wrong-way driver and a tractor-trailer, took place around 5:20 p.m. on the southbound lanes, leading to closures between Richmond and Bolton. 

Timothy Wooster, 45, from Jericho, reportedly drove northbound when he crossed over the median and collided head-on with Hailey Westcot's vehicle, a 21-year-old from Northfield. Subsequently, another car following Westcot also hit her vehicle after the initial impact, resulting in a rollover and extensive damage.

Westcot was pronounced deceased at the scene, while Wooster sustained serious injuries and was transported to a hospital. Currently, he faces charges of Grossly Negligent Operation with Death Resulting, although further legal actions may be considered as the inquiry is ongoing.
