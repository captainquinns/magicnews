Headline: Derry Store Sells $1 Million Powerball Ticket

Lottery enthusiasts are encouraged to review their tickets following the recent Powerball drawing. A ticket worth $1 million was sold at the Common Man Roadside in Derry, according to information from the New Hampshire Lottery. 

The winning numbers from the Saturday night drawing included 4, 5, 28, 52, and 69, with a specified Powerball number of 20. The player successfully matched all five main numbers but did not match the Powerball.

In total, this drawing saw seven additional $1 million winners across the United States, including locations such as California, Florida, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Ohio.

As there was no winner for the jackpot, the anticipated prize for the next drawing on Monday has surged to an estimated $1.6 billion, making it the fourth-largest prize in Powerball's history and the fifth-largest among all U.S. lottery drawings.
