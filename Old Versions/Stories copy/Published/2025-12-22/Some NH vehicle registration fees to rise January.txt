New Hampshire's residents will ring in the New Year with increased vehicle registration fees beginning January 1. As outlined in a report from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, over 50 new or modified state fees spanning various sectors, including agriculture and automotive, will take effect. The report indicates that these changes could present financial challenges, particularly for lower-income individuals and families, such as those receiving Medicaid.

In an effort to address a revenue shortfall in the state budget—the first such situation in four cycles—lawmakers have opted for these fee adjustments. This decision follows a decline in business tax revenues and the impending cessation of the interest and dividends tax by 2027. The revised fees vary widely, with some increasing by just cents while others may rise by tens of dollars. Approximately half of these new fees will implement on January 1, while the remainder was modified earlier in the year after the state budget was approved.

Research director Phil Sletten from the Fiscal Policy Institute highlighted that many of the fees have remained unchanged for a significant time, as they were established by statute. Some adjustments in costs for vehicle registration will see agricultural vehicle fees increase from $3.60 to $12, motorcycle registration fees rise from $15 to $30, and moped registration fees jump from $3 to $14. Sletten noted that for low-income individuals, these higher fees could constitute a larger portion of their limited resources.

The anticipated additional revenues from these fee hikes are projected to reach approximately $31.5 million over the next 18 months, driven mainly by increases from the Department of Safety. Medicaid enrollees will also face new monthly premiums, with costs ranging from $60 to $100, and families under the Children’s Health Insurance Program expected to pay between $190 and $270 monthly. These premium hikes will require federal authorization and are planned to be initiated by July 1, 2026.

In addition to the automotive sector, other areas, including healthcare, are experiencing fee increases. New copayment structures for prescription medications are estimated to generate an additional $750,000 annually. Other adjustments related to the Departments of Environmental Services, Fish and Game, and Agriculture, Markets, and Food will collectively contribute under $10 million in revenue each year. As the state navigates these financial changes, the implications for residents could be significant.
