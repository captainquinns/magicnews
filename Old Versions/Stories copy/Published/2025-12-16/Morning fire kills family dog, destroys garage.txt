Fire Destroys Garage and Results in Dog's Death in Townshend

A garage fire occurred early on Tuesday morning in Townshend, leading to the loss of a family dog and significant destruction. At approximately 7:45 a.m., emergency services were alerted to a blaze at 3896 Route 30, where flames had engulfed the garage and posed a threat to the nearby residence, which was fewer than 100 feet away.

Townshend Fire Chief Glen Beattie indicated that the garage was fully ablaze upon his arrival. Firefighters implemented defensive measures to prevent the fire from spreading. The homeowner successfully evacuated some pets and family members, although they unfortunately lost their six-year-old dog, which was inside the garage at the time.

The garage also served as the main facility for Havreluk Tree and Property Management, and the fire resulted in a complete loss of the structure. The family faced the unfortunate situation of losing essential equipment vital for their tree removal operations.

Beattie mentioned that the fire might have two potential causes and stated he would involve the state fire marshal to assist with the investigation. Fortunately, there were no injuries reported among the firefighting team, though the property owner suffered a minor burn on his hand.
