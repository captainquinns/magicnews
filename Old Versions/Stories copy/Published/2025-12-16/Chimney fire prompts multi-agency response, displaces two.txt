Headline: Fire on Mountain Road Engulfs Home, Leaves Two Displaced 

A house fire on Mountain Road led to a significant response from multiple fire departments and left two individuals without shelter on Sunday evening. 

Emergency personnel from Rindge and Jaffrey arrived at 44 Mountain Road around 7:45 p.m. to find intense flames within the walls and surrounding the chimney of the residence, which dates back to 1889. The initial responders quickly recognized the need for additional help and increased the response level to a second alarm shortly after their arrival, as indicated by a statement from the Rindge Fire Department.

Firefighters managed to control the visible flames within minutes but spent approximately two hours locating and extinguishing remaining hotspots in freezing conditions. The property experienced substantial damage from fire, smoke, and water, rendering it unlivable, as confirmed by Lieutenant Joseph Bevilacqua. 

The fire was attributed to a blockage in the chimney of the pellet stove. The New Hampshire Fire Marshal's Office recently took to Facebook to advise homeowners on the importance of having their chimneys and vents cleaned and inspected by a certified expert at least once a year.

Support at the scene was provided by crews and equipment from several neighboring towns including Jaffrey, Fitzwilliam, Troy, Richmond, Peterborough, New Ipswich, as well as departments from Winchendon, Ashby, and Ashburnham in Massachusetts, along with Great Brook EMS.
