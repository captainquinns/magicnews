Keene's Property Tax Rate Ranks as Second Highest in New Hampshire

The property tax rate in Keene has increased to $34.37 per $1,000 of assessed value, marking a rise of $1.30 from the previous year, predominantly due to a significant hike in local education taxes. 

The New Hampshire Department of Revenue Administration established this rate by assessing all approved budget allocations across city, county, and school entities, alongside projected revenues. This year's adjustment resulted in an increased rate, despite an overall estimated drop in Keene's total assessed property value by $2 million. 

The primary contributor to the tax increase stems from local education taxes, which surged by 77 cents, moving from $15.16 to $15.93. Initial estimates for the School District indicated a potential 17 percent rise in local education property tax, which ultimately exceeded 19 percent. Other tax categories experienced smaller increments: the municipal tax rate rose by 30 cents, the county rate increased by 19 cents, and the state education rate saw a minor increase of four cents.

As a result of this adjustment, Keene has the second highest property tax rate in New Hampshire, falling just behind Charlestown, where the rate is set at $36.54. Other nearby towns in Cheshire County include Hinsdale at $31.19, Westmoreland at $25.92, and Marlborough at $31.24.

The average home value in Keene is reported to be $341,104 according to Zillow.com. Based on the newly adjusted tax rate of $34.37, the property tax bill for an average home will amount to $11,723.75. In comparison, in 2024, the average home value was $320,000 with a tax rate of $33.07, resulting in a property tax of $10,582.40, which is over $1,000 less than the current rate.
