Keene's Downtown Infrastructure Project Faces Cost Overruns

Recent bids for the Downtown Infrastructure Project in Keene have significantly surpassed the city's budget estimates, with proposals coming in roughly $8 million over the expected cost. At a full City Council meeting held on Thursday night, City Manager Elizabeth Ferland announced that the lowest bid was approximately $28 million from Casella Construction of Pittsford, Vermont, while a second submission from Albanese D&S of Dracut, Massachusetts, totaled around $30.8 million. The city's budget for the project was initially set at $19 million.

Ferland explained that no decisions would be made at the meeting regarding the bids, emphasizing that staff will thoroughly review the proposals before discussing the next steps during the January meeting of the Municipal Services, Facilities and Infrastructure Committee. Potential options may include rebidding the project in the spring, as city officials seek to evaluate their choices transparently.

Originally set for bidding in the spring, the project experienced delays that pushed back the timeline to 2026 according to council decisions made in January. Subsequent discussions led to a forecast that costs may reach nearly $5.5 million more than the previously estimated $17.4 million, prompting the council to approve cuts to certain project components and shorten the construction phase from three years to two. The revised estimate of approximately $20 million was supplied by Stantec, the engineering firm involved.

During the meeting, concerns were raised regarding Stantec’s previous estimates compared to the submitted bids. Some councilors expressed frustration over the disparity, suggesting that the firm, which also sought a contract for the Gilbo Avenue Solar Pavilion Project, should not be engaged again. A vote to reject Stantec for this new project passed with a count of 10-5, with prominent opposition from Councilors Mitch Greenwald and Randy Filiault.

In addition to the discussions about the infrastructure project, the council also passed several ordinances and resolutions, including adjustments to zoning regulations for a portion of Maple Avenue and updates to the Community Revitalization Tax Program. Notably, the meeting marked the conclusion of terms for three city council members, who were honored for their service.

As Keene navigates its infrastructure ambitions amidst budget challenges, the city remains committed to exploring solutions that will benefit the community while thoroughly assessing prospective contracts and project viability.
