Drive-By Shooting at Jaffrey Apartment Complex Under Investigation

Authorities are looking into a drive-by shooting incident that occurred on Wednesday evening in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, where several bullets hit a multi-family housing unit on Cross Street. Fortunately, there were no reported injuries from the event. 

Emergency services responded to multiple 911 calls about gunfire around 5:53 p.m. near the junction of Cross Street and Nutting Road. Upon arrival, police discovered that the shots had been discharged from a vehicle traveling past 3 Cross Street, with some bullets impacting the structure and at least one entering an apartment. 

The police temporarily closed Cross Street for approximately two hours to ensure the safety of residents, gather evidence, and question neighbors for any witnesses to the incident. Investigators suspect that the shooting was deliberate and reassured the community that there is no broader threat to public safety.

Assisting in the response were officers from the Peterborough Police Department, New Hampshire State Police, and the Jaffrey Fire Department. As the inquiry continues, details regarding any suspects or the involved vehicle remain undisclosed.
