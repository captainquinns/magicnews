Every year, Consumer Reports surveys its members about problems they experienced with their vehicles over the past 12 months to help determine which car brands offer the best value for the price.

The survey tracks issues ranging from minor problems, such as trim and infotainment systems, to more serious concerns involving engines, transmissions and electric motors.

"The problem is once the warranty expires, that's when an unreliable new car becomes a real headache and it starts costing you time and money," said Mike Quincy of Consumer Reports.

This year's analysis included data from about 380,000 vehicles.

Toyota, Subaru, Lexus, Honda and BMW ranked among the top five brands for overall reliability.

"The same automakers continue to dominate our top brand ratings. And that's because when they're looking at redesigning a model, they're not making huge seismic changes to their models and all the models across the line use shared components," Quincy said.

Consumer Reports' latest findings show electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids remain more trouble-prone than traditional gas-powered models. Conventional hybrids, which don't need to be plugged in, continue to stand out.

"Hybrids are a more complex bit of machinery compared to regular internal combustion. But some manufacturers, in particular Toyota and also Hyundai and Kia, have been at it so long and they've worked out the processes to make their hybrid models super reliable," Quincy said.

Along with better fuel economy, Consumer Reports experts say hybrid vehicles often deliver a smoother driving experience than traditional gas models.
