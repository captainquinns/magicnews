A former Youth Development Center employee found guilty of being an accomplice to aggravated felonious sexual assault is seeking a new trial.

The New Hampshire attorney general's office has confirmed that Bradley Asbury is seeking a new trial, and according to court documents, it's because of newly discovered evidence.

The grounds for this new trial are centered on what defense attorneys are calling false testimony at the trial by the victim, Michael Gilpatrick.

News 9 normally does not disclose the names of victims of sexual assault, but Gilpatrick has been outspoken about his abuse.

Specifically, Asbury's attorneys are saying in court documents obtained by News 9 that Gilpatrick falsely testified at the trial about the timing of the assault and the existence of his signature on a discipline report.

Also, defense attorneys say that Gilpatrick and his wife falsely testified about taking out loans and that they did not care about financial compensation from abuse claims.

Asbury's attorneys also maintain Gilpatrick falsely accused a YDC teacher and youth counselor of sexual assault.

In November 2024, Asbury was convicted of two counts of being an accomplice to aggravated felonious sexual assault in connection with allegations from the 1990s.

Asbury received two 10- to 20-year sentences .

The New Hampshire attorney general’s office is planning a response to this request for a new trial, which is expected at the end of this month.

WMUR has made a call to Asbury's attorney to get additional details, but we have not heard back yet.
