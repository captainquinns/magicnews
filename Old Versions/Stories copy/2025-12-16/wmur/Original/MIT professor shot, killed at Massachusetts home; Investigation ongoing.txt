A professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been identified as the man fatally shot at a home in Brookline, Massachusetts, on Monday night, the school confirmed Tuesday.

Nuno F.G. Loureiro, 47, was shot at his home on Gibbs Street at about 8 p.m. He was taken to an area hospital with apparent gunshot wounds and died Tuesday morning, according to the Norfolk County district attorney’s office.

"Professor Nuno Loureiro, who died early this morning, was a current MIT faculty member in the departments of Nuclear Science & Engineering and Physics, as well as the Director of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center," the school said in a statement.

"Our deepest sympathies are with his family, students, colleagues, and all those who are grieving," the school said. "Focused outreach and conversations are taking place within our community to offer care and support for those who knew Prof. Loureiro."

Officials said it's an active and ongoing homicide investigation involving the Norfolk County district attorney’s office, Massachusetts State Police, Brookline police and MIT police.

No arrests have been made.
