PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (WCAX) - A New York man who admitted to his role in a North Country murder has been sentenced to 3 to 6 years behind bars.

Chad Nichols pleaded guilty this fall in connection to the murder of Jhafari Joseph in Peru, New York, last December.

The Vermontville man admitted to hindering prosecution, tampering with physical evidence, and concealment of a human corpse.

Timothy Timmons, considered the ring-leader, was found guilty of second-degree murder in October. He will likely be sentenced in January. His former wife, Kelly Timmons, previously pleaded guilty to a gun charge in connection with the murder.
