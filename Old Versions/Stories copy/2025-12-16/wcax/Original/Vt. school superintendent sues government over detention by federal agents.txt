WINOOSKI, Vt. (WCAX) - The superintendent of Winooski’s school district is suing the government over what he calls a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.

Wilmer Chavarria said he was detained by federal agents in Texas while he was on his way back to the U.S. from Nicaragua in July. He said Customs and Border Patrol agents demanded access to his cellphone and laptop, without a warrant.

A 2018 directive allows CBP agents to conduct warrantless searches of personal devices within 100 miles of a U.S. border.

The Pacific Legal Foundation , which filed the lawsuit on Chavarria’s behalf , said Americans don’t surrender their constitutional rights when they travel internationally.
