More than 5 feet of snow currently blanket Vermont’s tallest peak — the deepest powder in recorded history for Mount Mansfield on this date.

The Mount Mansfield snow stake hit 63 inches Thursday, said Burlington-based National Weather Service meteorologist Adrianna Kremer, more than 3 feet deeper than the average 22-inch depth expected this time of year. As of Tuesday, the snow depth at the stake was 61 inches, falling 2 inches due to compaction, Kremer added.

“We do have such a good snow pack early in the season,” Kremer said. “But, as always, there’s a lot of variability as the season goes on.”

Vermont has seen significant snowfall so far this winter, with over 3 feet recorded in November in some areas of the northern Green Mountains, Kremer said.

With 192 inches of overall snowfall Tuesday, Jay Peak has been graced with the most snow of any ski mountain in the U.S . so far this season, surpassing West Coast ski resorts in powder.

Northern Vermont ski resorts Smuggler’s Notch and Stowe are also keeping pace, with overall snowfall hitting 116 inches and 108 inches , respectively, as of Tuesday.

But warmer temperatures this Thursday will spur some snow melt. While that may bring modest river rise, Kremer said the service does not expect flooding, as the increase in temperature is predicted to be short-lived and this year’s powdery snow is less dense with liquid.

Hazardous travel conditions could arrive Friday, though, Kremer warned, as the snap back to colder temperatures brings the potential for a flash freeze and bursts of snow.
