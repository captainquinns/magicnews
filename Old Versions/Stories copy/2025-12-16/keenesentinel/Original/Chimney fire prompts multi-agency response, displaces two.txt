RINDGE — A fire at a home on Mountain Road prompted a response from several area fire departments and left two people without a home Sunday evening.

According to Rindge Fire Lt. Joseph Bevilacqua, Rindge and Jaffrey firefighters responded to 44 Mountain Road around 7:45 p.m. and found heavy fire in the walls and around the chimney in the middle of the home, which was built in 1889.

First responders upgraded the fire to second alarm status, meaning it needed more resources than initially thought, shortly after the first crew arrived, a news release from the Rindge fire department said.

Firefighters suppressed the visible fire within a few minutes, then spent about two hours searching for and putting out hotspots in single-digit cold, the release said.

The home sustained fire, smoke and water damage and was left uninhabitable, Bevilacqua said.

The fire was caused by a blockage in the pellet stove chimney, according to the release.

In a statement posted to Facebook, the N.H. Fire Marshal’s Office recently reminded residents to get chimneys and vents cleaned and inspected by a qualified professional at least annually.

Rindge Fire was assisted on scene by firefighters and trucks from Jaffrey, Fitzwilliam, Troy, Richmond, Peterborough, New Ipswich, Winchendon, Mass., Ashby, Mass., Ashburnham, Mass., and Great Brook EMS.
