CONCORD — A Keene man was sentenced in U.S. District Court in Concord Monday for possession of child sexual abuse material.

Connor Mueller, 31, was sentenced to three years in prison and five years of probation, according to a news release Tuesday from the N.H. Attorney General’s Office.

The state agency said Mueller was identified in a 2023 undercover investigation by law enforcement. The investigation, headed by Homeland Security, found Mueller was using peer-to-peer software to get videos of child sexual abuse, the release said.

Authorities later searched Mueller’s home and found multiple devices that had images and videos of child sexual abuse on them, according to the release.
