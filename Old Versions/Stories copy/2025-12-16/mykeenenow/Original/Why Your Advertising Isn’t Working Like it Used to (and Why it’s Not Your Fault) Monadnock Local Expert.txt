If advertising feels less effective, it’s not your business that changed — it’s how customers search, compare, and choose, often long before they ever reach out.

If your advertising isn’t working the way it used to, I understand that you may not know why. And honestly, that’s not your fault.

You’ve been doing things the way they worked for years — and for a long time, that was enough.

But something has changed. Not your business. Not the advertising. Not the economy.

The customer changed.

If the way you’re advertising doesn’t match the way people choose businesses today, you’re missing new customers quietly, every single week.

Let me walk you through what’s actually happening now, because once you see it, you can’t unsee it.

Someone needs or wants something — it could be anything — snow tires, a car, a plumber, a dentist, furniture, a snowmobile, lunch. It doesn’t matter because it all happens the same way.

Their first move isn’t to call a business. It’s not to ask a friend. It’s not even to remember the ad they saw or heard earlier. Their first move is a search. It’s what we all do now — we get interested and want something, then we go search. Immediately. Instinctively. Google has trained all of us to do this without thinking.

In seconds, they’re looking at options, prices, reviews, photos, availability — and yes, your website and your competitors’ websites. They’re comparing everything long before you ever know they’re out there.

This moment — right here — is where you win or lose almost every customer.

Then the next thing happens — they narrow the list. They decide who looks trustworthy based on very simple things:

Are the reviews recent? Does the website make sense? Does this business “feel” professional and legitimate? Does what I see match what I’m looking for?

This is all happening silently, behind the scenes.

By the time they decide to reach out to a business, their mind is already mostly made up. If you weren’t one of the final options they trusted enough to contact, you never even made the list — and you’d never know you were in the running.

Again, none of this is because there’s something wrong with your business. It’s because the customer evolved faster than the way businesses use advertising to get their message to them.

Here’s the part I want you to hear clearly: It’s completely fixable.

When your advertising and your online presence finally match the way people find, connect with and choose today, everything starts to make sense again. You show up when and where they are looking with a message that matches why they are looking. Then while they are deciding you are constantly re-engaging and reinviting them to consider your business. You may not get them all, but you should get more. And then you stop wondering why advertising “isn’t working like it used to.” Because now, it’s working the way the new customers work— not against it.

Look, I’m not going to pretend we’re automatically the right fit for you. We might be. We might not be. The truth is neither of us knows that until we sit down and talk.

What I can tell you is this: If any part of this felt familiar — if it made something click — maybe it’s worth a conversation. Not a pitch. Not a pressure meeting. Just a conversation at the end of which you’ll know if we are a good fit for each other .

If you think you’re ready for that, I’ll be here.
