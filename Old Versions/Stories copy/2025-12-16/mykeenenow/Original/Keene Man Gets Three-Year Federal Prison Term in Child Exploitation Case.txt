A 31-year-old Keene man was sentenced in federal court to three years in prison after admitting to possessing child sexual abuse material.

CONCORD, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) A Keene man will spend three years in federal prison after authorities uncovered a collection of child sexual abuse material on multiple electronic devices at his home, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

U.S. District Judge Steven McAuliffe sentenced Connor Mueller, 31, to 36 months in prison followed by five years of supervised release during a hearing in Concord on Tuesday. Mueller previously pleaded guilty in 2023 to a charge of possessing child sexual abuse material.

Federal prosecutors said Mueller was identified during an undercover law enforcement operation that targeted the use of specialized peer-to-peer file-sharing software. Investigators determined that the software was being used to obtain videos depicting child sexual abuse and also allowed other users to access material shared by Mueller.

A subsequent search of Mueller’s residence led agents to seize several electronic devices. Authorities said the devices collectively contained numerous images and videos involving the sexual abuse of children.

The investigation was led by Homeland Security Investigations, with assistance from the New Hampshire Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force and the Keene Police Department. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Vicinonzo.

Federal officials said the prosecution was part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide Department of Justice initiative launched in 2006 to strengthen efforts to investigate and prosecute child exploitation crimes and to identify and protect victims.
