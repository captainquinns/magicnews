More than $9 million in new federal grants will boost child care, infrastructure, historic preservation and rural development across New Hampshire.

MONADNOCK REGION, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) New Hampshire communities will see more than $9 million in new federal investment following the latest round of Northern Border Regional Commission grants, supporting projects that range from child care expansion to historic preservation and infrastructure upgrades.

The funding, announced Monday, flows through the NBRC’s Catalyst, Timber for Transit and Forest Economy programs, which target economic and community development in rural areas across the northern tier of New England and New York. The money will support initiatives in six New Hampshire counties, including Cheshire and Sullivan.

Members of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation said the awards will help address long-standing needs in small towns and rural centers — from workforce shortages and aging public facilities to limited access to health care and childcare.

The NBRC was created to bolster communities in northern and rural regions by aiding business development, improving public infrastructure and supporting tourism and outdoor recreation. In New Hampshire, eligible counties include Belknap, Carroll, Cheshire, Coos, Grafton and Sullivan.

U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee, recently helped secure additional money for the agency in federal spending legislation. Sen. Maggie Hassan and U.S. Reps. Chris Pappas and Maggie Goodlander also praised the new round of grants, saying they expect the projects to deliver long-term economic benefits.

Acworth Historical Society — $268,311 A major overhaul is planned for the Acworth Village Store, a historic center of community life. The grant will support flood-resilience upgrades, ADA accessibility improvements and energy-efficiency work. The project is designed to keep the store a viable hub for local farmers, artisans and small businesses.

Rise for Baby and Family (Cheshire County) — $288,493.96 Rise will expand its Complete Pathway to Career program, which trains and supports early childhood educators. Through credentialing assistance, mentoring and career advising, the initiative aims to ease staffing shortages and open more child-care opportunities for working families.

Keene Day Care Center — $892,847 The center plans to add 20 new child-care slots and maintain 70 existing ones through building upgrades and staff development. Improvements include HVAC and window replacements, as well as sprinkler installation, all intended to create a safer, more efficient environment for young children and educators.

Historic Harrisville — $1,000,000 A $1 million award will help replace the village’s aging wastewater system and transform a vacant mill building into new commercial and community meeting spaces. The project is expected to generate 25 jobs, reinforce the area’s tourism and business base, and safeguard key services such as child care and the community center.

Additional NBRC grants elsewhere in the state will support forest-industry development, outdoor recreation projects, water-system upgrades and other initiatives aimed at strengthening rural economies.
