Police are seeking the public’s help to track down whoever is responsible for the gunshots fired at a home’s outdoor holiday decorations early Tuesday morning.

Police said around 1 a.m. Tuesday, several inflatable Christmas displays were shot at outside a home on Risingwood Drive in Bow.

Police said they believe the gunshots were fired from the roadway, which suggests to investigators that the alleged perpetrator or perpetrators were either inside a vehicle or standing in the road when the shots were fired.

“This act of vandalism is not only destructive to private property but, more importantly, poses a serious and reckless danger to the residents of this neighborhood,” police wrote in a press release.

Charges of criminal mischief and reckless conduct involving a firearm could potentially be filed in this case, if a suspect or suspects are arrested, police said.

No one was injured in connection with the shots.

Police are asking residents who live in the area or along any adjacent streets to review home surveillance camera footage from between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. Tuesday. They are looking for images or videos of suspicious vehicles or potential suspects.

Anyone with information is asked to call Lt. Matt Pratte at 603-223-3950. Tips can be submitted anonymously at this link .
