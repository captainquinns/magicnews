New Hampshire is getting another shot of bitterly cold air Tuesday and a snow chance on Wednesday as the mid-winter feel continues.

After a very cold start Tuesday, temperatures will be a bit more tolerable by the afternoon. Expect sunny skies and lighter winds.

Afternoon highs are expected to reach the low 20s in northern areas and the mid- to high 20s in southern zones.

Increasing clouds in the evening could bring a few scattered snow showers after 8 p.m.

While Wednesday morning's commute looks mostly dry, a round of light snow is likely by late in the morning in some areas as a storm moves in from the west.

An accumulation of about 2-4 inches of snow is possible north and west of Concord, including the Monadnock Region, the Lakes Region, the Upper Valley and points farther north.

Roads could become slippery in areas that receive snow Wednesday afternoon and evening.

As temperatures rise, snow quickly turns to rain in Concord and communities to the south and east.

It will be sunny and we will be cooling down again on Thursday and Friday.

Light snow showers possible on Saturday and there is a chance of snow Sunday, according to a few of the computer models. The Storm Watch 9 team will track that closely.
