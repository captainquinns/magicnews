WASHINGTON (WCAX) - Vermont Senator Peter Welch is among lawmakers criticizing the Trump administration’s $12 billion farm bailout.

The president unveiled the package on Monday to help boost farmers who have struggled to sell their crops after being hit by retaliatory tariffs from China as part of a broader trade war.

Welch blames the president for creating the need for a bailout in the first place. “You have a government policy that destroyed the ability of farmers to sell their product, and now you have the tariffs, which caused the problem being used by the president to send a check -- a support check -- and that’s not what farmers want,” Welch said. “They want to grow their crop, they want to sell their crop, and they don’t want to be dependent on the government for handouts.”

Trump blamed his predecessor for the problem, saying inflation under President Biden crushed farmers.

The Trump administration’s payments for farmers are scheduled to be distributed in February.
