BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Lake Champlain is healing. That’s according to its leading experts. But, they also argue the state has a long way to go if it wants to adapt to the Earth’s changing climate and keep a healthy basin.

“Cold water fish need cold water, and when the lake is warmer overall, their habitat is squished,” said Matt Vaughn from the Lake Champlain Basin Program.

Floods, drought and runoff are changing the lake. Since 2011, the basin has survived 25 extreme weather disasters. Wildlife has had to adapt, and so have businesses.

“Forty percent of businesses that are confronted with a natural disaster never reopen. An even higher percentage close after two years, so that’s a real devastating financial impact, it’s also a devastating emotional impact for a small business owner,” said Mike Pieciak, D-Vt. Treasurer.

The lake’s advocates gathered at Rock Point Monday night to assemble and declare their requests to the Legislature.

They believe that by acting in the interest of the lake, the government can help everyone from the state’s largest businesses to its smallest fish.

This session, they’re asking the lawmakers to advance flood mitigation by restoring wetlands and flood plains, removing obsolete dams and rightsizing culverts.

They also want the state to reduce water contamination by monitoring PFAS and reducing road salt use.

They would also like the state to invest in aquatic invasive species management and to increase public access to the southern part of the lake.

“When we have so many challenges, and we have such a tight budget situation, we have to be realistic about what is the amount of money we can come up with to make these investments,” said Pieciak.

Vermont’s legislative session begins on Jan. 6.
