Investigators are looking into whether the killing of an MIT professor and last weekend's mass shooting at Brown University are possibly connected, multiple law enforcement sources told our sister station WCVB and the Associated Press.

Sources told WCVB and the AP that law enforcement officials have internally identified a person they believe is connected to both cases. No name was released.

This new investigative lead came to be within the past 24 hours, sources told ABC News.

Two people were killed and nine others were injured in the shooting just after 4 p.m. Saturday at Brown's Barus and Holley engineering building, where exams were scheduled.

A memorial has been set up at the Van Wickle Gates on Brown's campus to honor sophomore Ella Cook and freshman Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokow, the two students who lost their lives.

Then, two days later, Nuno F.G. Loureiro, 47, was shot around 9 p.m. Monday at his home on Gibbs Street in Brookline, Massachusetts. He was taken to an area hospital with apparent gunshot wounds and died the next morning, according to the Norfolk County district attorney’s office.

Loureiro was an MIT faculty member in the departments of Nuclear Science & Engineering and Physics, as well as the Director of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center.

No arrests have been made in either case.

In Providence, officials have released several images of a person of interest in the shooting, but to date, he has not been identified.
