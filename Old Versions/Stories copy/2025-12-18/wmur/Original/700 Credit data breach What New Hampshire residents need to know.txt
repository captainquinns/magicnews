A Michigan-based company that helps car dealerships with financing and credit reports is working to contact nearly 6 million Americans after a data breach.

The breach affects more than 25,000 Granite Staters.

According to 700 Credit , certain records were copied without permission during the October breach. Some of the information included Social Security numbers.

The company says it is reviewing its policies to reduce the chance of a similar breach in the future.

It is also offering those who are affected a free year of credit monitoring.
