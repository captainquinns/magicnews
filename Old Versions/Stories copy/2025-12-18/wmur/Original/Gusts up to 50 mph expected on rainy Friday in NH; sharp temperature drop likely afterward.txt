A surge of mild air will send a brief round of heavy rain and locally strong wind gusts through New Hampshire on Friday.

Climbing temperatures and dew points will create widespread fog due to melting snow. This will help to lower visibility on the roads Friday morning.

The winds will also pick up on Friday morning, with some southerly gusts up to 50 mph possible along the coast and in parts of the White Mountains.

A Wind Advisory is in effect for all of New Hampshire from 8 a.m. Friday through 7 p.m.

Scattered showers will develop Friday morning, though travel for the commute is unlikely to be impacted by the rain.

A narrow band of heavy rain and downpours will then race through the state around midday and into the early afternoon. At the same time, the strongest winds will develop along and just ahead of that line of rain.

Travel will be impacted the most between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.

The rain should rapidly taper off during the evening commute, but a sharp drop in temperatures is forecast as winds shift direction and blow in out of the west-northwest late Friday into Saturday.

The winds could dry out roads before any icy spots form for the Friday evening commute and overnight into early Saturday, but drivers should keep the possibility of slippery travel conditions in mind.

The weather looks quiet ahead of a busy weekend of travel and holiday shopping.

On Saturday, there could be some locally strong wind gusts over eastern slopes of the White Mountains.

During the day, expect fair skies and cooler conditions, with highs in the 30s.

It could be a touch warmer on Sunday, which is the first day of winter. Expect some clouds and partial sun with a chance of a few spotty mixed or snow showers, mainly north.
