Walpole resident Jerry McDougle gets his exercise in the winter the old-fashioned way, with two sticks attached to his feet and two in his hands — in other words, he likes to cross country ski. McDougle was in town on Monday to get some shopping done, and decided to take the opportunity to ski a quick route around Wheelock Park. Most of the time he skis closer to home, he said adding that he is hoping for more snow soon so that he can begin skiing the wooded trails.
