With holiday travel expected to reach record levels, bipartisan leaders in Congress are warning consumers about a surge in travel scams targeting airline tickets, hotel bookings and car rentals, urging travelers to stay vigilant and book only through official websites.

WASHINGTON, D.C. (MyKeeneNow) With record numbers of Americans expected to hit the roads and skies for the holidays, leaders of the congressional Joint Economic Committee are urging travelers to be on guard against a growing wave of travel-related scams.

Members from both parties said this week that fraud targeting airline tickets, hotel reservations and car rentals tends to surge during peak travel periods, costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Committee leaders noted that reports of travel scams jumped sharply during last year’s holiday season and continue to climb as more bookings move online.

U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, the committee’s ranking member, said scammers often exploit the stress and urgency that comes with holiday travel. Fraudsters commonly pose as legitimate airlines, hotels or rental platforms, she said, luring consumers to fake websites or deceptive links designed to steal money or personal information.

Committee Chairman Rep. David Schweikert of Arizona echoed those concerns, warning that organized criminal networks increasingly rely on sophisticated online tactics to target travelers. He encouraged consumers to avoid clicking on unsolicited links, to be wary of unfamiliar third-party booking sites, and to complete transactions directly through official airline, hotel or rental company websites whenever possible.

Vice Chairman Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri said awareness is key, especially with more than half of Americans planning to travel during the holidays. Fake websites that closely mimic well-known brands remain one of the most common tools used by scammers, he said.

Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia, the committee’s senior House Democrat, added that scam operations grow more advanced every year, making vigilance essential for travelers hoping to avoid costly and stressful disruptions during the holidays.

Consumer advocates backed the committee’s warning. Representatives from the Global Anti-Scam Alliance and AARP said scammers frequently rely on pressure tactics, such as claims that a deal will expire immediately or demands for payment through unusual methods. They urged travelers to slow down, verify offers and resist high-pressure requests.

The travel scam alert is part of a broader push by Hassan and other lawmakers to highlight the growing impact of fraud, which they say now rivals or exceeds other major illicit industries worldwide. Committee leaders are encouraging travelers to review the full alert for tips on spotting red flags and protecting themselves as the holiday travel season ramps up.
