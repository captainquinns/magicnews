Bandit is a lovable, 90-pound cuddlebug with an adventurous spirit, perfect for an active adopter looking for a sweet and energetic companion.

SWANZEY, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Bandit, an adult male dog, is what staff affectionately describe as a “living, breathing Squishmallow”—a 90-pound bundle of affection who’s convinced he’s the perfect lapdog. Sweet, social, and full of curiosity, Bandit walks beautifully on leash, sticking close as he takes in the world with eager sniffs and happy enthusiasm.

An active and intelligent dog, Bandit thrives with enrichment and plenty of exercise to keep both his body and mind satisfied. He’s selective about his canine friends and would do best in a cat-free home, as cats are simply a little too strange for his taste. While he doesn’t have extensive experience with children, his size and gentle nature may make him a good match for sturdier, dog-savvy kids.

Bandit is affectionate, energetic, and ready for an adopter who enjoys an active lifestyle and lots of companionship. He’s eager to meet new people—and might just lean right into your heart.
