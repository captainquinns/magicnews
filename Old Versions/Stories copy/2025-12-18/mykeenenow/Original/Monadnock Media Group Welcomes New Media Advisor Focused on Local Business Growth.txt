Monadnock Media Group has hired Pamela Tambourine as a Media Advisor, bringing business ownership, marketing experience and a passion for helping local companies grow to the Keene-based media organization.

KEENE, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Monadnock Media Group has added a new member to its sales and marketing team.

Pamela Tambourine was hired as a Media Advisor, a role she began in November. Tambourine brings years of business ownership and marketing experience to the Keene-based media company.

Originally from the East Coast, Tambourine spent 25 years in the Lake Tahoe area. She relocated to the region to support her daughter, an NCAA Division III women’s ice hockey goalie, because she was recruited to Keene State College.

Most recently Tambourine had lived in Nashua.

With few long-term ties to their previous stops, the family (Tambourine’s husband works remotely) decided to continue moving where their daughter’s career took her. “We left, we didn’t have any really roots or ties in Nashua. So we continue to follow her, so we can watch her games and just let her live her dream.”

Alongside that family commitment, Tambourine arrives with an extensive professional background. She has owned and operated multiple businesses, including health and wellness studios, and worked as a permanent makeup artist with a focus on paramedical services.

Her career as a makeup artist was centered on the paramedical side of it, she explained.

“It means I help(ed) people camouflage things and help(ed) cancer survivors — women— get whatever they consider beauty back (via) permanent makeup,” she said.

Her experience also includes senior management roles and community involvement in other states, where she saw firsthand how marketing choices can shape a business’s success.

“I spend the money in digital marketing,” she said, “and if you don’t spend the money in that, no one can find you. I didn’t understand you need to spend money to make money.”

In her new role, she hopes to apply those lessons to support businesses throughout the Monadnock region. “This is a small town, and I really want to help businesses thrive. What can I get involved with? What can I teach and help everyone learn from the road that I went down? What can I help them do differently or continue to do?” she said.

For now, Tambourine is focused on learning the internal workings of Monadnock Media Group and building local connections.

“I’m looking forward to understanding more of the administrative side of (the business), getting them in the community, doing all the steps,” she said. “I can’t wait to implement them and get out there and talk to people.”

As she settles into the position, Tambourine said she hopes to encourage businesses to embrace a mix of outreach tools in an increasingly competitive market.

“I just want to let people understand how important traditional and digital marketing are,” she said.
