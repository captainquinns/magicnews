Goose is a fully feral, one-year-old cat best suited for life as a working barn cat, where he can live independently and put his instincts to work.

SWANZEY, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Goose, a 1-year-old neutered barn cat, knows exactly who he is—and he’s not pretending to be a house cat. Trapped on a local property after spending months outdoors, Goose remains fully feral and most comfortable living life on his own terms. For him, the great outdoors isn’t a phase—it’s home.

Goose would thrive as a working barn cat, where he can patrol, explore, and put his natural hunting instincts to good use. He’s coexisted well with other barn cats at the shelter and would likely settle in with other animals in a similar setting. While he may stay hidden at first, once acclimated, Goose is ready to take his role as a dedicated barn guardian seriously.

If you’re looking for a low-maintenance, hardworking addition to your property, Goose could be the perfect fit—quietly doing his job while enjoying the independence he prefers.
