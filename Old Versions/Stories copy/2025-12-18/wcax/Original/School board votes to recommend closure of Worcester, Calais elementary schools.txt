EAST MONTPELIER, Vt. (WCAX) - School leaders in Central Vermont on Wednesday voted to recommend the closure of elementary schools in the towns of Worcester and Calais.

Emotions were high at Wednesday night’s Washington Central Unified Union School District school board meeting as supporters and opponents of the closure plan spoke out.

The issue has been on the table since last year and is due to declining enrollment and a decrease in state funding amid the state’s ongoing education restructuring struggles.

Parents, staff and former students weighed in ahead of the school board’s vote, many of whom expressed their strong connections to the schools facing closure.

“I attended a large school from preschool to second grade. When I switched to Calais, I finally made true, meaningful friendships. Friendships that were real because I got to know the kids on a more personal level. I feel more connected to my school, my classmates, and my teachers. I’m not just part of this school. This school and community are part of me‚" said Paige, a current Calais Elementary School student.

In the end, the board voted to recommend closure of both Doty and Calais Elementary schools in June, and they voted to have the towns of Calais and Worcester vote on those closures on Feb. 10.

As part of the plan, the district would consolidate from five elementary schools down to three, and sixth graders in the district would move to U-32 in the 2027-2028 school year.
