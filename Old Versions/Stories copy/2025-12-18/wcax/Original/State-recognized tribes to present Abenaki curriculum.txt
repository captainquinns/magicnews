MONTPELIER, Vt. (WCAX) - A new curriculum on the Abenaki people will soon be available to classrooms around the region.

The Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs and the four state-recognized tribes in Vermont have announced the American Abenaki curriculum.

It’s the first comprehensive curriculum designed by and with American Abenaki communities. It will include a dedicated website featuring classroom resources, lesson plans, multimedia tools, and educator support materials.
