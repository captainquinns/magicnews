RICHMOND, Vt. (WCAX) - Police say at least one person is dead after a multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 89 that involved a wrong-way driver, a tractor-trailer and other vehicles.

It happened at about 5:20 p.m. on I-89 southbound in Richmond, closing both southbound lanes from Richmond to Bolton.

Police say Timothy Wooster, 45, of Jericho, was driving northbound when he crossed the median, eventually crashing head-on into the car of Hailey Westcot, 21, of Northfield.

A third car, travelling southbound along with Westcot, also collided with her car after the initial crash, causing a rollover and more damage.

Westcot was pronounced dead at the scene. Wooster was taken to the hospital with serious injuries.

For now, Wooster is charged with Grossly Negligent Operation with Death Resulting. More charges may come as the investigation continues.
