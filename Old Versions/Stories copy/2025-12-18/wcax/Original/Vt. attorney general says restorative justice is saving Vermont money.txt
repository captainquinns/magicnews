BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Vermont is saving money and reducing recidivism rates through its restorative justice programs, according to a new report from Vermont’s Attorney General’s Office.

Restorative justice programs are what some low-level crimes are referred to in an effort to reduce court backlogs and save money.

According to the Report to the Vermont Legislature On Court Diversion and Pretrial Services , 20% of all misdemeanors in Vermont over the past three years have been handled through restorative justice. Going through the program costs 15% of what a trial costs.

“We have a criminal justice backlog in the courts. If we can get cases that are lower-level crimes into a program that’s very effective at healing victims and healing perpetrators, and is not even bothering to go to court, well, that’s just a win for efficiency, and for the taxpayers and for public safety,” said Attorney General Charity Clark, D-Vt.

Results show the program has not been successful with repeat offenders and those driving with a suspended license.

Clark says they are still fine-tuning the program.
