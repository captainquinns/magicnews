MONTPELIER, Vt. (WCAX) - A Vermont man with an abusive past pleaded not guilty to attempted murder after police say he attacked a man with a hatchet.

Police said Eric Shepard, 55, attacked the victim early Tuesday morning in Barre, leaving the man with multiple gashes to his head. Court paperwork shows the victim said it happened when he wouldn’t let Shepard into his camper.

Shepard was out on parole stemming from a 2010 assault and robbery conviction.

In court on Thursday, he pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and to an accusation that he stole from several convenience stores.

Shepard was held without bail and will likely face more jail time for violating his parole.
