More than 100 vehicles were towed overnight in Manchester to allow road crews to clean up from Tuesday's snowstorm.

The lot at Derryfield Park was filled Wednesday with cars that were towed during the parking ban in Manchester.

Department of Public Works officials said 167 cars were towed during the ban. They said 20 to 30 times more vehicles remained on city streets despite the snow emergency and could also have been towed.

Owners of towed vehicles have to pay a $200 fine to get their cars back.

DPW workers were continuing to clear the roads, and they said that once they were done, they would start work on the sidewalks, prioritizing sidewalks next to schools.

"The storm has been great," said Manchester resident Lori Collins. "They did a great job with the roads. I think the pretreatment really helped. I just wonder what it's going to do to the environment."

Residents said dealing with snow is just part of living in New England.

"The first one is always a little tough, but after that – we live in New England. You get used to it," said Manchester resident Mike Flaherty.

Flaherty works for the city and said he was going to spend the day shoveling out fire hydrants.
