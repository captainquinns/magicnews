TMZ obtained the video of Bruna Ferreira's arrest last month in Massachusetts. She was on her way to pick up her son in New Hampshire.

Ferreira's attorney said she came to the United States legally as a child and is trying to get a green card. Federal officials say her visa required her to leave the country in 1999.
