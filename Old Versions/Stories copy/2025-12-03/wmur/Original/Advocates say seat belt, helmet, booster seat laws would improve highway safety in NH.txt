A new report rating highway safety across the country is recommending that New Hampshire adopt some new rules of the road.

The "2026 Roadmap to Safety" annual report from Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety assigns all 50 states and Washington, D.C., a rating of green, yellow or red based on their traffic laws.

New Hampshire was rated yellow, the same as most states, including nearly all other New England states. Rhode Island was one of five states and Washington, D.C., that were rated green, along with Maryland, New York, Oregon and Washington.

The report recommended that, in order to improve road safety, New Hampshire adopt laws requiring the use of seat belts, motorcycle helmets and booster seats, along with several other recommendations.

"We all share the goal of reducing traffic-related fatalities, reducing accidents on our roadways, and we've got a responsibility to do that," said U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, D-New Hampshire.

Pappas said he and other lawmakers are considering first-time offender interlock laws and creating national standards to help reduce drunken driving.
