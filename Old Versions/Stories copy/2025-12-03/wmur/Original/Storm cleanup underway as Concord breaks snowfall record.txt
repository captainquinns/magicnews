Granite Staters were digging out Wednesday after a storm dropped several inches of snow across the state.

Concord broke a record for Dec. 2 with more than 6 inches of snow.

Rej Pathania, of Concord, was shoveling out with the help of his son, Alex.

"We've shoveled four times," Pathania said. "Moving a mountain a teaspoon at a time."

He said they were making sure to pace themselves as they worked to clear their driveway and sidewalk.

"Twenty minutes, and then we take a break, no matter how good you're feeling," he said.

Residents and plow drivers were working to make sure the snow was cleared before it turns to ice later in the week, when temperatures are forecast to get into the single digits .

"We've got to be ready for Friday," Pathania said.
