BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - The man accused of repeatedly threatening a Vermont prosecutor is now pleading guilty.

Todd Hoyte left numerous voicemails for Grand Isle State’s Attorney Doug DiSabito with derogatory remarks, hate speech and death threats.

It stems from a 2022 charge of aggravated domestic assault, which DiSabito prosecuted.

Hoyte originally pleaded not guilty back in May of this year. According to DiSabito, his plea was changed, and his sentencing is scheduled for April 1st.
