KEESEVILLE, N.Y. (WCAX) - A tractor-trailer crash closed part of Interstate 87 in the North County on Tuesday night.

New York’s 511 map showed a backup in the Keeseville area on the southbound side near Exit 34 just after 7 p.m.

New York State Police told WCAX they were closing it at Exit 35 southbound in Peru.

The interstate has since reopened. We don’t yet know any details about the crash or any injuries.
