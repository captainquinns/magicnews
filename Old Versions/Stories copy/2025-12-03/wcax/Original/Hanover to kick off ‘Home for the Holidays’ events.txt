HANOVER, N.H. (WCAX) - Decorations are going up in Hanover for a town-wide celebration of the holiday season that encourages residents to support local businesses.

Hanover Parks and Recreation staff were decorating a Christmas tree on Wednesday in front of the town hall as part of the Home for Holidays celebration , which will include events throughout December.

“December, January -- those can be some of the darkest times of the year. So, we definitely want to put up as many lights as possible,” said the town’s Hannah Falcone.

She says businesses are also decorating to complement the stars and other holiday lights downtown. “It’s just a great opportunity for people to come to downtown Hanover, grab a little pastry, a hot beverage, take a stroll around and look at the beautiful decorations,” Falcone said.

The celebration encourages shopping at locally owned stores like the Lemon Tree. Ann Fantini, who is visiting the area for her travel blog, said she tries to support small businesses as much as possible.

“I love little unique independent gift shops, and it just looked cute and charming and they have all sorts of ‘New Englandy’ things,” Fantini said.

While Hanover welcomes out-of-town visitors, the celebration is geared toward residents.

“I think this time of year is a great time to think about, ’How can I support my local community?’” said Morgan Brophy with the Upper Valley Business Alliance. She says nearly 70 cents on the dollar will stay in the community when spent at local stores. “We are always working with local businesses to come up with creative ways to highlight what they offer.”

The month-long event officially kicks off on Friday with the tree lighting on the Green.
