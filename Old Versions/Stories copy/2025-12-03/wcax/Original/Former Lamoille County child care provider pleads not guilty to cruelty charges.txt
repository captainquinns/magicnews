HYDE PARK, Vt. (WCAX) - A former Lamoille County child care provider has pleaded not guilty to multiple child cruelty charges.

Savannah McKenzie, 34, was charged in October with endangering infants in her care, in part by wrapping their heads in blankets. Court records include photos showing babies underneath blankets.

Her child care business, Savvy Family Childcare in Hyde Park, lost its license after a state inspection found dangerous sleeping conditions and other concerning violations.
