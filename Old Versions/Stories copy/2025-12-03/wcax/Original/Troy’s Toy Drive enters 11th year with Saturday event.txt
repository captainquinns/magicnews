ESSEX JCT, Vt. (WCAX) - Troy Austin’s annual toy drive is entering its 11th year, with organizers hoping to surpass last year’s collection.

The event will take place on Saturday from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. at Albert D. Lawson School in Essex Junction. Folks are asked to bring new, unwrapped gifts.

The event will feature decorated trucks, live music, a free train ride for children, and visits with Santa and Mrs. Claus.

Austin said the community turnout over the past decade has helped donate 10,000 toys total. “The most thing I’m excited for is just seeing everyone come out and giving back to the community and bringing a new unwrapped toy,” Austin said.

Organizers collected about 2,000 toys last year.
