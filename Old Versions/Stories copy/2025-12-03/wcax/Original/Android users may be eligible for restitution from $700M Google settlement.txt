NEW YORK (WBNG) -- New Yorkers may be entitled to restitution from a $700 million settlement with Google, according to a consumer alert issued by Attorney General Letitia James.

In December 2023, Attorney General James and 53 other attorneys general secured the settlement with Google

The lawsuit alleged that Google unlawfully maintained a monopoly over mobile app distribution and in-app payment processing for Android devices, charging consumers as much as 30% in fees for purchasing apps and making in-app purchases.

If the settlement is approved, the funds will be used to pay consumers who made purchases on the Google Play Store between August 2016 and September 2023 and were harmed by Google’s anticompetitive conduct.

Google has already paid $630 million into the settlement fund, and a majority of affected consumers will receive payment automatically.

Consumers will receive a message from PayPal or Venmo, notifying them of an incoming payment. If the contact information associated with their Google Play Account does not match that in their PayPal or Venmo account, the consumer will have the option to link their account or create a new account.

A supplemental claims process will be available for individuals who do not have a PayPal or Venmo account or who lack access to the contact information listed on their Google Play account.

A court hearing to approve the settlement will be held on April 30, 2026.
