BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - If you’re looking to get the most out of this weekend, we’ve got ways to celebrate across the map.

In Burlington, Friday night marks the last Festive Friday of the year. Lace up your sneakers for RunVermont’s Light Up the Night Fun Run & Walk downtown at 5:30. At 6:00, catch a parade of lit-up trucks, including SD Ireland’s famous cement mixer. On Sunday, check out a special Hanukkah gathering at sundown from 4-5 p.m.

Over in Randolph, you can watch free holiday movies at the Playhouse Movie Theater up until Christmas Eve . You can also find a holiday market and craft show on Saturday and a concert on Sunday.

If paper giftwrap is too boring for you, check out Manchester’s fabric gift wrapping on Saturday. On Sunday, meet Santa and grab some sweet treats at Christmas on North Meadow Farm.

For a twist on the holiday classics, head over to Plainfield for Combustible Cabaret’s holiday happening. On Friday and Saturday, meet a rowdy crew of “elf helpers” performing in 20 acts of holiday shenanigans.
