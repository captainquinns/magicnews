BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Officials on Friday honored the gift of organ donation, highlighting record numbers of life-saving transplants in New England.

New England Donor Services joined state and local officials in Burlington to pay recognize local donor families and recipients.

Laura Govendo Grell from Milton is among those who shared her story as the recipient of a double lung transplant after cystic fibrosis left her own lungs severely damaged.

“I’m so grateful that my donor said yes to organ donation and that his family was able to respect and honor his wishes in that moment, which saved my life,” Govendo Grell said.

In New England last year, 648 deceased donors donated organs resulting in more than 1,500 life-saving transplants.
