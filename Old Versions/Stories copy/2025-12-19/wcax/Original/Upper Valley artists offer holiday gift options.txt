WEST LEBANON, N.H. (WCAX) - Area shoppers looking to give the gift of the arts this holiday season can find locally made options that support artists year-round.

The Lebanon Art and Crafts Association pop-up store in West Lebanon features handmade items from about 35 members, including honey wax candles and stained glass wall clocks.

“People seem to be wanting the things that others have made,” said Barbara Richmond, who makes doll accessories.

The association’s annual show is the big event of the year, with a philosophy focused on preserving traditional crafts.

At Replay Art in White River Junction, the second-hand art supply store collects materials and supplies and sells them at “pay what you can” prices. “And you don’t have to be a capital ‘A’ artist or capital ‘C’ crafter especially for the holidays,” said the store’s Jamie Rosenfeld.

Members of the Upper Valley Arts Alliance were using the space Friday for their monthly meeting. Rosenfeld says supporting the arts is particularly important now. “The more that we can be supporting the arts right now when arts funding is being cut, the better,” she said.

The alliance’s Aaron Rivkin says the goal is to expand the arts across the region. “The arts are essential to life, it is what connects us, it’s what makes us human,” he said. “It makes it a smaller community.”

Back at the Lebanon Art and Crafts Association’s pop-up store, teaching the next generation of crafters is also part of the mission. “It’s just a way of life I think for anyone who is a crafter,” said the association’s Susan Matteson. “It is a lot better than being on a tablet or a device of some sort.”

The pop-up arts store in the Upper Valley will be open until 5 p.m. Christmas Eve.
