Law enforcement officials are crediting a person who published a Reddit post that led them to the suspect in the shootings of an MIT professor and at Brown University.

According to court documents, that man told investigators he encountered the suspect, Claudio Neves Valente, 48, in a bathroom on the ground floor of the Barus and Holley building on the Brown University campus, where the mass shooting occurred Saturday.

The Reddit post included what car Neves Valente was in and the car's plates, giving police the green light to look at more than 70 street cameras to find him.

Investigators said after Neves Valente left Providence, he stuck a Maine license plate over the rental car's plates to keep his identity hidden.

Officials said ultimately, the Reddit post that gave them all of this information is what sealed the search.

"That person led us to the car, which led us to the name, which led us to the photographs of that individual renting the car, which matched the clothing of our shooter here in Providence that matched the satchel that we see here in Providence. He was found dead with a satchel, with two firearms and evidence in the car that matches exactly what we see at the scene here in Providence," Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Nerohna said.

Police mentioned that surveillance video from Alamo Rent-a-Car matched what Neves Valente was wearing in the photos released earlier this week of the person of interest.

Investigators said they are confident that Neves Valente acted alone in the shootings. He was found dead Thursday night in Salem, New Hampshire, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
