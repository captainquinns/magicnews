The FBI Evidence Response Team was seen looking over a car Thursday night connected to the suspect in the Brown University shooting and the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor.

The suspect, identified as 48-year-old Claudio Neves Valente , was found dead inside a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, after authorities said he took his own life.

Officials said they located the suspect's car at the storage facility, which led them to Neves Valente.

Police said he rented the vehicle from an Alamo Rent A Car in Boston, Massachusetts, in late November.

Authorities described the car as a gray Nissan Sentra with Florida license plates. Investigators said Neves Valente later changed the plates in an effort to make the vehicle harder to track.

During a news conference, officials said they found evidence both inside the car and in the storage unit, including a gun at Neves Valente's feet and the satchel seen in the person-of-interest photos previously released to the public.

FBI evidence technicians were later seen wrapping the car while wearing hazmat suits to preserve potential DNA evidence inside and outside the vehicle.

Officials said the investigation is ongoing as they continue to process evidence and work to determine a motive behind the attacks.
