JAFFREY, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Police are investigating a drive-by shooting Wednesday evening after gunfire hit a multi-family apartment building on Cross Street, with several rounds penetrating an apartment unit. Authorities said no injuries were reported.

Officers were dispatched around 5:53 p.m. following multiple 911 calls reporting gunshots near the intersection of Cross Street and Nutting Road, according to a news release. When police arrived, they determined the shots were fired from a moving vehicle as it passed 3 Cross Street.

Several bullets struck the exterior of the building, and at least some entered one of the apartments, police said. Officers closed Cross Street for about two hours while they checked on residents, collected evidence, and canvassed the neighborhood for witnesses.
