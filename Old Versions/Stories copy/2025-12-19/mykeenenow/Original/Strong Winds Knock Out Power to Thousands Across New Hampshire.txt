Gusty conditions caused widespread power outages Friday afternoon, leaving more than 10,000 customers without electricity statewide, though fewer than 150 were affected in the Monadnock Region.

CONCORD, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Strong winds sweeping across New Hampshire knocked out electricity to thousands of customers Friday afternoon, prompting state officials to activate emergency monitoring and urge residents to take safety precautions.

As of about 1 p.m., utilities reported more than 10,000 customers without power statewide as gusty conditions moved through the region. In the Monadnock Region, however, outages were far more limited, with fewer than 150 customers affected at this time.

The National Weather Service issued a Wind Advisory for much of the state, and the State Emergency Operations Center was placed on enhanced monitoring status to track impacts and coordinate response if needed.

Utility crews were responding to outages as they occurred, according to state officials. Robert Buxton, director of the state Department of Safety’s Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, emphasized that safety should be the top priority for residents dealing with power loss.

He cautioned against running generators indoors or in enclosed spaces and urged people to stay well clear of any downed power lines, calling 911 to report them.

Residents are encouraged to report outages directly to their electric provider and to continue reporting every 24 hours until service is restored. Officials also recommend using flashlights instead of candles, driving cautiously and watching for utility crews on roadways, and treating dark traffic signals as four-way stops.

State emergency managers advise residents to stay informed by signing up for NH Alerts and monitoring National Weather Service broadcasts. Additional information on power outage safety is available at ReadyNH.gov.
