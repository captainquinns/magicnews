The chilly pattern continues this weekend with light snow possible for some.

As clouds thicken this evening, scattered light snow showers will be possible, although it's not likely to affect travel conditions.

Some few flurries or light snow showers are possible early, otherwise clouds will give way to some sunshine and another chilly day.

Highs will top out in the upper 20s for most areas.

Bitterly cold air returns for Monday, as the day will begin with lows in the single digits and teens and highs will top out in the low 20s.

After that, it looks as if the Granite State will slowly warm up through the middle and end of next week!
