ESSEX JUNCTION, Vt. (WCAX) - If you took a walk in downtown Essex Junction this Friday night, you probably wouldn’t understand why it’s so busy, but if you take a look inside the window, you might find a little train that will give you a hint as to why.

“So you look at the model train, and then you find someone to put your stamp up on your paper,” said 7-year-old Kaya Lamphere

Visit a new place, catch the train, and get your paper stamped. That’s the formula Lamphere and her friend Molly Driscoll have been following all night. They found their way into Yankee Pride Quilts to meet some new friends.

“It’s been very festive. People have been enjoying themselves. A few people came in and said I didn’t know you were here, and we’ll be back, so that’s always good,” said Marti Delnevo of Yankee Pride Quilts.

Delnevo was working at the shop a little late on Friday night. It was dark outside, but the inside was illuminated with seasonal spectacles. They had more than 80 visitors during the train hop.

After retrieving the stamp, families and friends journey to the next establishment.

“It’s kind of been a tradition in our family,” said 15-year-old Finn Hamilton.

Hamilton does the train hop every year. He loves the train station, the hot chocolate, and spending time with his family and friends. But mostly, he’s in it for the prize at the end.

“You get a train!” said Lucy LaTrave of Essex Junction.

There are 17 stops on the hop. The Parks and Rec event encourages folks to shop local for Christmas and spend time with the neighbors. It’s all merry and fun and will be back next year.
