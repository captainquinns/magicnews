BRANDON, Vt. (WCAX) - Creating a replica village out of a tasty treat.

Living Hope Church hopes to give a new perspective to the town of Brandon this holiday.

The local community spent weeks creating some of the town’s most recognizable buildings out of gingerbread.

Now, they want your help voting on which creation is the best.

The sculptures are also helping out the Brandon Food Shelf, as all proceeds will benefit the organization.

Organizers say they hope to benefit the local area in multiple ways with the display.

“Get a little excitement going in the community and have people come out, and maybe, have a little outing with the family and have something to do... Make people aware of the needs of the community, and it’s not just through the Christmas season, it’s through the entire year,” said Steven Lubinski with Living Hope Church.

The miniature Brandon is open for your viewing for the final time at Living Hope Church this Saturday from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
