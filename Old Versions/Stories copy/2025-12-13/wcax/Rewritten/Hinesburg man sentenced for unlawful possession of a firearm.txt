Hinesburg Resident Receives Sentence for Illegal Firearm Possession

A Hinesburg man has been sentenced after admitting to illegal possession of a firearm. In October of the previous year, authorities in Burlington discovered the 32-year-old individual, Anthony Seagroves, alongside others in a running vehicle that had been reported stolen. During the investigation, police located a ghost gun on the seat where Seagroves was sitting. At the time, he had prior felony convictions for burglary. This individual was previously in the news due to his arrest on kidnapping charges in July 2024, which followed an extensive search leading to a residence on Richmond Road. In this recent firearms case, he received a sentence of 2 years and 2 months in prison.
