Keene Mayor Jay Kahn outlined challenges facing the city—from taxes to bridges to housing—during a wide-ranging interview on WKBK’s morning show.

KEENE, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Keene Mayor Jay Kahn covered everything from property taxes to bridge repairs during a Monday appearance on Good Morning with Dan Mitchell on WKBK, offering listeners a broad look at the pressures facing local government as he begins another term.

Kahn opened the conversation with light humor about the hectic pace of public service before quickly turning to one of the morning’s major themes: New Hampshire’s patchwork of more than 100 School Administrative Units. Mitchell raised the idea of consolidating SAUs to cut administrative costs, but Kahn said such proposals rarely gain traction because of strong attachments to local control. He also warned that large regionalized school systems could dilute community representation.

On property taxes, Kahn said Keene isn’t alone in wrestling with high bills tied largely to school spending. He noted that state lawmakers have been hesitant to expand revenue sources beyond longstanding standbys like lottery and alcohol income, leaving local budgets under strain.

Infrastructure concerns—especially Keene’s aging bridges—took up a significant portion of the interview. Kahn described century-old structures now on the state’s “red list,” forcing emergency vehicles to take longer routes and accelerating the city’s repair schedule. He praised the Public Works Department for keeping up with sewer lining and road work while preparing for major bridge projects.

The interview also touched on state revenue sharing and the “meals and rooms” formula, which Kahn said cities pushed successfully to keep tied to percentages rather than capped amounts. Even so, he said communities with less tourism—including Keene—don’t see the same boost as other regions.

Housing and homelessness were another focus. Kahn described a unified effort by several New Hampshire mayors to seek more state support for shelter beds, services and affordable housing development. Some funding increases have come through, he said, though often with restrictions that make local implementation difficult.

Mitchell and Kahn also discussed civic engagement and local politics, praising neighborhood advocacy in recent land-use decisions that protected green spaces. Kahn said Keene’s public process can slow some decisions but leads to better outcomes. He also noted that although council service can be demanding—and occasionally unpleasant due to online criticism—Keene remains less partisan than many communities.

The mayor highlighted internal leadership development within City Hall, saying retirements in recent years were part of a normal generational shift rather than turmoil. He cited long-tenured staff who have risen into new roles, calling Keene an “employer of choice.”

On the Main Street improvement project, Kahn said a contractor should be selected soon and that the city is working to support downtown businesses throughout construction. He also addressed the narrow passage of new bike-lane safety rules, saying the measure originated from public feedback and will require shared responsibility from motorists and cyclists.

Kahn expressed concern about recent layoffs and program reductions at Keene State College, noting that the school is deeply tied to the region’s economy and workforce pipeline. He said he hopes to reinvigorate a joint city-college commission and plans to meet with other mayors, the governor and business leaders to push for stronger state investment in higher education.
