PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (WCAX) - The North Country Chamber of Commerce unveiled a new campaign focused on fostering cultural ties with our Canadian neighbors.

The “We Know Canadians As...” video was unveiled Monday morning in Plattsburgh. It includes facts about the relationship between the two countries, including their alliance and support during wars.

The campaign comes as political rhetoric and federal policy by the Trump administration have led to a drop in crossings at the northern border.

“Often, Plattsburgh in our region is looked at as Montreal’s U.S. suburbs, but it is bigger in the aperture of that relationship. It is every border community north and south that has a deep and meaningful relationship,” said Assemblyman Michael Cashman, D-N.Y. 115th District.
