TOWN OF WADDINGTON, New York (WWNY) - State police say a husband attacked his wife in their town of Waddington home over the weekend, ending with her death and his suicide.

Troopers say 70-year-old Paul McGrath assaulted his 66-year-old wife, Yvonne, with a knife and hammer while she was in bed Sunday morning.

Despite severe injuries, police say Yvonne McGrath was able to flee her home on State Route 37, get in her SUV and drive off.

Her vehicle crashed a few miles away on Route 37. Police were called to the scene at around 7:45 a.m.

According to troopers, Yvonne McGrath was rushed to Canton–Potsdam Hospital, where she later died from her injuries.

Her death was ruled a homicide.

An autopsy showed that she died from a large cut to her neck, severe skull fractures, and brain injuries due to sharp force and severe blunt force injuries.

When police went to McGrath’s home to notify the household about her death, they say they found Paul McGrath dead.

An autopsy on Paul McGrath determined that his cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging. His death was ruled a suicide.

Shelly Smith lives near the McGrath home.

“The shock is still there today (Monday). It still comes to the front of your mind that this has just happened two doors down,” she said.

It’s something that has rattled the town and its leaders.

“Waddington is a small town. It’s a small community. Almost everybody knows each other, so I’m certain that they were known within the community and that their loss will be felt,” said Waddington Mayor Mike Zagrobelny.
