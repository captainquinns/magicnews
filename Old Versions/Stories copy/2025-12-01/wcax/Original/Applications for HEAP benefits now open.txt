NEW YORK (WBNG) -- The Home Energy Assistance Program, or HEAP, which helps New Yorkers heat their homes during the cold winter months, has been restored following the government shutdown.

The program is intended to help lower-income residents pay their heating bills, based on a variety of criteria, including income, household size, primary heating source options and more.

Benefits for households that pay directly for heat based on usage are paid directly to the vendor that supplies the primary source of heat. Participating vendors can be viewed here.

Enrollment applications for the program open on Monday, Dec. 1.

Director of Clean Energy Programs for Network for a Sustainable Tomorrow, Adam Flint, explained that those who qualify for other state benefits would also qualify for HEAP benefits.
