EAST CORINTH, Vt. (WCAX) - Vermont Governor Phil Scott visited Martin’s Tree Farm on Monday to cut down a few Christmas trees. But like some others in the Upper Valley, the farm is struggling after drought killed about half of its planted trees.

Armed with a hand saw, Scott spent more than half an hour searching for the perfect evergreens at the farm run by Mary and Jeff Martin. The farm grows 6,000 trees and operates mostly as a cut-your-own retail operation, no wholesale.

“It takes me a long time to find the right tree,” Scott said.

Scott selected three trees for the Statehouse Pavilion, including one for the governor’s office and one for his home. He paid for the trees with a personal check.

The visit highlighted the challenges facing Vermont Christmas tree farms after the summer drought. The Martins said about 50% of the trees planted at the farm died because of the dry conditions.

“Nothing I’ve ever seen before. Our lawns were like Rice Krispies,” Mary Martin said.

Despite the losses, Martin said her trees are resilient and the drought is just part of farming.

Danielle Fitzko, Vermont’s commissioner of Forest, Parks and Recreation, said water is crucial for establishing new Christmas trees.

“When you’re looking at a Christmas Tree farm and establishing new trees, the most important thing they need is water,” Fitzko said.

The state reports that despite the drought, tree growers have a healthy supply of Christmas trees available this season.

As for the governor, he got a workout and some Vermont-grown trees to celebrate the season.

“Oh, it’s part of the tradition,” Scott said of his annual tree-cutting trip.
