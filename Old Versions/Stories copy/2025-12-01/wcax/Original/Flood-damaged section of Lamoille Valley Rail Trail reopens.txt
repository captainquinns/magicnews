ST. JOHNSBURY, Vt. (WCAX) - A segment of the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail has reopened after flood damage forced it to close for more than a year.

The section runs from Mount Vernon Street in St. Johnsbury to Danville. Crews will finish final repairs in 2026, so the section will temporarily close again.

But for now, the trail is open from St. Johnsbury to Swanton with one detour in West Danville.
