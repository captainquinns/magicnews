Title: Temporary Zoning Adjustments Aim for Improved Community Integration

BRATTLEBORO — The Select Board made a decision on December 8 with a 3-2 vote to initiate a public hearing regarding interim zoning regulations affecting social services, following rising concerns linked to the facility at 69A Elliot Street. This move reflects a response to issues related to the operations at 69A, where unhoused individuals have been gathering to access various resources. 

Under these new regulations, the classification of Social Services or Charitable Assistance will shift from being a permitted use to a conditional use across the Urban Center, Village Center, Neighborhood Center, Mixed Use, and Institutional Zoning areas. As a result, any applications for permits in these zones will now require consideration during public meetings held by the Brattleboro Development Review Board (DRB). Town staff indicated in their communication that this adjustment aims to safeguard public health, safety, and overall welfare, while also promoting an orderly growth process economically and physically.

Throughout the months leading up to this decision, the town documented extensive engagement concerning 69A, tallying 136 contacts alongside numerous incidents requiring police and emergency services, which amounted to an estimated cost of approximately $51,500. Reports mentioned various safety concerns, including overdoses, loitering, and misconduct, alongside inquiries regarding how these issues were managed within the community. 

The mechanism for implementing these temporary zoning bylaws is established by state law and can be done swiftly following only one public hearing. These regulations can remain in effect for a period of up to two years unless extended or formally altered through standard processes. A petition from 5 percent of the local electorate also provides a route for reconsideration or amendment of such bylaws.

Board member Isaac Evans-Frantz and Vice Chairman Oscar Heller voted against this zoning adjustment, with Evans-Frantz emphasizing that the recent move of 69A to a larger space warranted further evaluation and a delay in decision-making. He highlighted the necessity for a thorough examination of whether the situation truly warranted an emergency response, especially given the timing of the public hearing coinciding with major holidays.

Concerns were raised during the hearing from residents worried about the implications for community safety and cohesion. One resident expressed apprehension about the welfare of families in the vicinity and the strain placed on law enforcement resources due to activities associated with the facility. Opinions differed on how best to harmonize social services alongside local businesses, with some suggesting that cooperative dialogues could enhance relationships and reduce strain on the community.

Board Chairwoman Elizabeth McLoughlin remarked on the robustness of the staff's presentation while stressing the need for effective coexistence between social services and neighboring establishments. She characterized the bylaw as a strategic tool to ensure that social assistance groups operate responsibly and in consideration of the broader community.

The DRB’s considerations will encompass the compatibility of proposed conditional uses with surrounding properties, requiring evidence from applicants to prove that their initiatives can exist harmoniously within the locality. The interim zoning and associated processes are framed not as barriers but as mechanisms to foster constructive community interactions going forward.

Future actions will be monitored by the Planning Commission, which will provide insights on the outcomes of these bylaw changes before they are solidified into permanent regulations.
