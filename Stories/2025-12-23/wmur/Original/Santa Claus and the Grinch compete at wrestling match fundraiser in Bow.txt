It was a wrestling match for the ages Monday night at Bow High School between Santa Claus and the Grinch.

The event, which was put on by the Bow Brawlers Youth Wrestling Club, collected donations for the New Hampshire Food Bank.

Video shared with News 9 Sports shows someone dressed as Santa slamming his Grinch opponent to the mat for the pin.
