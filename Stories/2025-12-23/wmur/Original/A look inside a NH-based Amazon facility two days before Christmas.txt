An Amazon facility in Hooksett is working around the clock trying to deliver packages ahead of Christmas.

The facility, known as DNH2, serves about 40% of New Hampshire and processes thousands of packages each day, which are sorted and loaded onto delivery trucks.

More than 200 employees work at the facility which is open 7 days a week.

"It's exciting, you know, it's heading into Christmas," said Jon Woodward, the facility's operations manager. "There's a lot, we do 75,000 packages plus a day. It's a very busy 24-7 operation."

Woodward said delivery drivers play a critical role in getting packages to customers' doors during the holiday rush.

"Delivering those smiles is what it's all about," he said. "Crunch time right now, last 48 hours."

Jeff Falkingham, owner of NHBlacklabs Delivery, said safety remains the top priority for drivers.

"The most important thing here is to make sure you get it to your house and safely," Falkingham said.

On Tuesday, Santa lended a helping hand, testing out a slip, trip and fall prevention simulator designed to prepare drivers for certain weather conditions.

Santa also showed a bit of the Integrated Last Mile Delivery Academy, an immersive, hands-on safety training program.

More than 110,000 delivery drivers have completed the program as winter arrives across New England.
