Mercedes-Benz has reached a settlement with dozens of states, including New Hampshire, over a diesel emissions scandal.

The coalition of states accused the automaker of lying about their vehicles' pollution levels in their marketing and in emissions tests.

Under the settlement, Mercedes will pay nearly $150 million.

According to the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office, New Hampshire will receive more than $360,000 from that settlement.
