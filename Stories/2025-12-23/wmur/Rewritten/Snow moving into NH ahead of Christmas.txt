Headline: Winter Weather Expected in New Hampshire Ahead of Christmas

Cold and snowy weather is anticipated across New Hampshire on Tuesday, just before the Christmas holiday. Most of Maine and all of Carroll County in New Hampshire are under a winter storm warning, while a winter weather advisory is in place for the remaining parts of the state, excluding areas near the Massachusetts border.

The day began with chilly temperatures and an increasing cloud cover, leading to the onset of snow in the early afternoon. The snowfall is expected to persist into the evening, which may create slick road conditions and reduce visibility, resulting in a slower commute for many travelers.

Southern regions and the far western parts of New Hampshire could accumulate between 1 to 3 inches of snow, while higher elevations may see totals reaching up to 4 inches. Areas such as the Lakes Region, the White Mountains, and the North Country are likely to receive 3 to 6 inches of snow.

As the storm intensifies offshore on Tuesday night, heavier snow is predicted for eastern Maine, with some of the more intense snow showers possibly reaching northeastern New Hampshire, potentially adding another inch or two in the White Mountains by Wednesday morning.

On Wednesday morning, snowflakes are expected to linger but will clear early, with colder and breezy conditions setting in as Christmas Eve approaches. Flurries might be observed in central and northern parts of New Hampshire on Christmas Day, although a generally calm weather pattern is forecast for the holiday.

The best weather for traveling after Christmas is predicted for Friday. However, another system might move in, bringing light snow and wintry precipitation on Friday night into Saturday morning, followed by the possibility of snow or a snowy mix from a new system on Sunday.
