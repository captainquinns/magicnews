Maine Woman Avoids Jail Time for Burying Friend's Body in Backyard

A woman from Maine has received a sentence that allows her to avoid prison despite admitting to burying her best friend's remains in her backyard several years ago. Vernelle Jackson, aged 87, appeared in Oxford County Court where she pleaded guilty to offenses including abuse of a corpse, theft, and forgery.

The charges stemmed from Jackson's actions following the death of her friend, Mae Shelton, in 2019. Prosecutors revealed that Jackson had unlawfully collected more than $30,000 in checks from Shelton's name, including retirement funds from Virginia and Supplemental Security Income. Additionally, she was accused of utilizing Shelton's SNAP benefits and writing bad checks totaling over $8,000 from the deceased's account.

Investigators uncovered Shelton’s body from Jackson's yard on September 16, 2019. Jackson claimed that Shelton had expressed a desire to be buried in the backyard of their shared home located on Harrison Road. In a statement made in September 2019, she detailed how she wrapped Shelton's body in a tarp and transported it to dig a burial site, a task she found physically taxing due to her health conditions.

Jackson's attorney noted that the case had complexities involving other individuals, indicating that members of Jackson's family may have influenced her actions regarding the deceased's checks. Jackson's lawyer stated that while she accepted responsibility, there were others involved in the financial misconduct.

In court, the judge acknowledged the gravity of the situation, mentioning that the consequences would have been more severe had Jackson’s health been better. Following Jackson's plea, the court required her to pay restitution of $10 each month.

This recent plea occurred after an earlier hearing in September had gone awry, when Jackson's not guilty plea on one charge disrupted a potential plea agreement.
