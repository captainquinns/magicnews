SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - A group of local restaurants is making sure everyone is fed this Christmas.

The Farmhouse Group includes Chittenden County staples like the Farmhouse, Pascolo and the Guild Tavern.

This holiday season, volunteers prepared and packaged 1,200 meals for those in need.

The group started the tradition about three years ago as a way to give back and help make the community a little brighter around the holiday season.

“It’s just really nice to give back to the community, everyone deserves to be fed, especially around the holidays,” said Kate Reid, the marketing director for Farmhouse.

The meals will go to nonprofits around Chittenden County, like the Committee on Temporary Shelter, the Fletcher Free Library, Steps to End Domestic Violence and other organizations.
