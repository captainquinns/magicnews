SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Hundreds of millions of Americans are hitting the road this Christmas, many having to plan around the forecast to avoid holiday headaches.

A lot of travelers hitting the roads on Tuesday said they wanted to get ahead of the snow.

Some people we talked to said they’re staying local this year, keeping quiet at home to avoid any holiday stress. Others were headed out of state to visit family and friends. They said if they do run into snow, they’re prepared.

“I got four-wheel drive, I also drive for work, so I feel pretty confident on the roads, but definitely try to get there sooner than later, I guess,” said Ryan Wagner of South Burlington.

It’s also a big day for air travel, with many people expected to fly out of the Burlington airport.
