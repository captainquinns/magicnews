BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - The state of Vermont is suing the Trump administration to prevent it from completely defunding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .

According to the lawsuit , Russel Vought, the acting director of the CFPB, is attempting to defund the agency by refusing to request funding from the Federal Reserve.

Without that money, the CFPB would run out of funding in January.

The lawsuit alleges this violates constitutional separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.

The CFPB has reimbursed over $21 billion of money improperly taken from over 205 million Americans in 14 years.
