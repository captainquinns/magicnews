CONCORD, N.H. (WCAX) - A New Hampshire man has been indicted on multiple felony charges for allegedly making bomb threats against the governor.

Tristan Anderson, of Hooksett, was arrested in September after police said he threatened to target New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte. They did not provide details about the nature of those threats.

Now, a grand jury in Merrimack County has indicted Anderson on three felony charges, including attempted harm to government officials, attempted throwing or placing of explosives and threats against government officials.

Anderson has been behind bars since his arrest and will remain there until his first court appearance on Jan. 8.

If convicted, he could spend up to 15 years in prison.
