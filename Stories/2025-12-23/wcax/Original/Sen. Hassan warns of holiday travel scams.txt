BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - As holiday travel picks up this week, so will holiday scams. And as AI becomes more convincing, you will want to stay vigilant so you don’t become a victim.

A major credit card company found a 28% increase in travel fraud last winter.

New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan warns that some scammers create fake travel sites or impersonate airlines or hotels to get your money.

You can protect yourself by only using legitimate websites, not clicking on links that come to you through text or email, and watching out for misspellings.

“The best way to protect your hard-earned money is to use official websites and apps,” said Hassan, D-New Hampshire.

Popular scams around the holidays include things like fake flight notifications, unexpected outreach and fake customer service numbers.

Scams are usually vague in language, promote urgency and often give deals that are too good to be true.

When in doubt, don’t click on links. Reach out to the business or organization through their official channels instead.

Travel scams now surpass the drug trade as an illicit industry.
