WINOOSKI, Vt. (WCAX) - An outdoor ice skating rink is coming to Winooski’s Rotary Park this winter.

The city’s Recreation and Parks Department posted a picture on Instagram saying, “It’s happening!”

The rink is not ready just yet. Officials ask people not to skate on it yet to give the ice time to freeze.

Signs around the rink say it will open the day after Christmas.

The rink appears to be located in front of the water feature.
