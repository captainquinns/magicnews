WILLISTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Decking the halls could be a doozy this season as things like holiday meal staples and gifts come at a higher cost.

According to a CBS News analysis , food prices are nearly 18% higher compared to January 2022.

A Forbes report points to holiday fixings like ham and some canned and fresh fruit and vegetables as pricier.

Many common holiday gifts, like clothing or jewelry, are more expensive, too.

That’s leading people across the country and in Vermont to cut back on holiday spending .

One couple shopping at Walmart in Williston said they’ve shopped for gifts at the Dollar Store and picked up free food to make ends meet this season.

“It’s a lot better to get something free because, you know, you’re not going to go hungry, and I don’t know, it kind of puts you in a depression. But these places, these places are a lot cheaper than going to the regular grocery store,” said Cheryl Mendicino.

Reporter Sophia Thomas: How important is it to you to be able to save money?

Patrick Mendicino: It’s really important because, you know, we’re not... I’m disabled, and she’s working, and we got Medicare. We’re poor.

The latest polls from the Associated Press show 68% of U.S. adults say the country’s economy is poor.
