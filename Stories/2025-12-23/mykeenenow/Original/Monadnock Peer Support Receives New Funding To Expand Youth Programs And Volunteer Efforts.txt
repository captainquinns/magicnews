Monadnock Peer Support has received a combined $12,000 in new funding to launch a youth peer support pilot and strengthen its volunteer program across the region.

KEENE, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Monadnock Peer Support is closing out the year with new financial support aimed at broadening its reach and deepening its impact in the Monadnock Region.

The Keene-based nonprofit recently received $8,000 from Badger to help launch a pilot youth peer support program, along with a $4,000 grant from Volunteer NH to build a structured volunteer program.

The donation from Badger will allow Monadnock Peer Support to take its long-standing peer-led mental health model and begin adapting it for young people. While the organization has offered free, non-clinical support for adults for three decades, funding for youth programming has remained out of reach until now.

Program Director Stacy Wilbur said young people are increasingly looking for spaces where they can connect with others who understand what they are going through.

“This generous gift allows us to take an important first step toward building peer-driven support specifically for young people,” Wilbur said.

The planned pilot program will focus on creating welcoming, non-clinical spaces where youth can share experiences, learn coping skills, and support one another through peer connection rather than traditional therapy.

At the same time, the grant from Volunteer NH will help the organization strengthen its internal capacity by developing a more formal volunteer program. The funding will be used to bring in an outside consultant to help create systems for recruiting, training, and supporting volunteers.

Administrative Director Karen Richi said volunteers are essential to expanding access to peer support in the community.

“This grant allows us to thoughtfully build a volunteer program that ensures volunteers feel prepared, valued, and connected to the people and community we serve,” Richi said.

Volunteer NH provides grants to organizations across the state to help increase volunteer engagement, with funding support coming in part from the American Rescue Plan through the State of New Hampshire.

Badger, based in Gilsum, donates 10 percent of its pre-tax profits each year to nonprofit organizations focused on children’s health and well-being, local communities, and the promotion of peace and wellness.
