Brandon Residents Craft Town Replica from Gingerbread 

Community members in Brandon, Vermont have come together to construct a gingerbread version of their town, aiming to share a unique celebration during the holidays. Living Hope Church has organized this event, which showcases iconic buildings from Brandon made entirely from gingerbread, created over several weeks by local participants. Residents are invited to help determine which gingerbread creation stands out as the best. 

Additionally, proceeds from this initiative will support the Brandon Food Shelf, helping to address community needs beyond the holiday season. Organizers express their desire to foster enthusiasm and encourage family outings, emphasizing the importance of awareness regarding ongoing local requirements. The final viewing of this gingerbread display will take place at Living Hope Church on Saturday, with doors open from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.
