HINESBURG, Vt. (WCAX) - A Hinesburg man pleaded guilty to felony firearm possession.

Last October, Burlington police found 32-year-old anothony seagroves and others slouched over in a running car, which had been reported stolen.

That’s when they found a ghost gun in the seat of the car he was sitting in.

At that point, he had already been convicted of a felony burglary.

We’ve reported on Seagroves before. He was also arrested on kidnapping charges back in July of 2024 after an hours-long search that ended at a home on Richmond Road.

In this firearms case, he was sentenced today to 2 years and 2 months in prison.
