The man who authorities said cut off his ankle monitor to evade police was captured in Nashua, and it was all captured on camera.

Video showed the moments police and the U.S. Marshals threw flash bangs and surrounded a vehicle on Shedd Ave in Nashua with their weapons drawn to capture Matthew Mann.

"It seemed that they were picked up from a Lyft driver, and as the Lyft driver was coming through the neighborhood, it was stopped by the SWAT team, so the Lyft driver was terrified with his hands on the windshield and had no idea what was going on," said Anthony Danieli.

The U.S. Marshal Service told News 9 that Mann, who is charged with drug-related offenses, was taken to the hospital for treatment.

Mann was given an ankle monitor and told to turn himself in at Valley Street upon release, but he cut the monitor and fled, authorities said.

Authorities got evidence that Mann was hiding in Nashua and had been monitoring a home nearby Scripture Street since Wednesday. Officials said there was evidence that Mann had a firearm and made threats about hurting himself and others if approached by police.

"I just stayed in my house. It was scary, it was definitely scary. I mean, I don't know about that sort of thing," said Lindsey Ferragamo.

Nashua police cleared Mann at the hospital, and he was returned to Valley Street jail, where he is being held.
