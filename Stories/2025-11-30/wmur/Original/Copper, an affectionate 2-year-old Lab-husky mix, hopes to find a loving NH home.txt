Copper, a 2-year-old Lab-husky mix, is looking for a loving home in New Hampshire.

Weighing about 60 pounds, Copper has a bright, friendly demeanor and loves any chance to be outdoors.

Whether it's a walk, hike or run, Copper is a reliable, enthusiastic partner.

During downtime, he happily entertains himself by tossing his toys into the air. He also enjoys cuddling, offering a nice balance of energy, affection and good manners.

Copper would do well in a home with older children who can appreciate his playful side. He gets along with other dogs and would thrive with a well-mannered canine companion.

Cats and small animals tend to overstimulate him, so a home without them is best.

Copper is ready for the next chapter of his life with a family that can offer guidance, support and a stable environment.

If you're looking for an intelligent, personable dog who can keep up with an active lifestyle and still enjoy quiet time at home, Copper may be the perfect fit.
