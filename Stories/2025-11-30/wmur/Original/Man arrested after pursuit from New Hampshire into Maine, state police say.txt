A man was arrested after a pursuit from New Hampshire ended in Maine early Sunday, authorities said.

Maine State Police said just after midnight, they got a call from New Hampshire State Police requesting help in a pursuit. New Hampshire State Police were trying to stop a Dodge Ram pickup truck due to speeding and erratic driving, authorities said.

The pickup truck, driven by Matthew Olsen, 44, of Harrison, Maine, did not stop for a local New Hampshire police department and, during the chase, rammed a New Hampshire State Police cruiser, authorities said.

Olsen entered Maine on the Turnpike, and Maine State Police troopers took over the pursuit, which continued north until Olsen drove over a curb at the Kennebunk Rest Area, damaging his tires before getting back on Interstate 95, Maine State Police said.

Troopers disabled Olsen's truck using a PIT maneuver, authorities said. Olsen was arrested and charged with operating under the influence, eluding an officer, criminal speed and reckless conduct, authorities said.

He was taken to a local hospital as a precaution before being taken to jail, state police said.
