SPRINGFIELD, Vt. (WCAX) - The River Valley Tech Center hosted the VEX Robotics Holiday Tournament, bringing together teams of middle and high school students from across the twin state region.

Students built and coded their own robots, then tested their creations against each other in a series of challenges. The tournament showcased the intersection of engineering, programming and competition as gears ground and machines buzzed throughout the event.

For some participants, the experience represents more than just competition. Luke Strange from the River Valley RADs said he loves putting software together and seeing how everything is made up of bits and pieces.

“That makes me feel like I can actually do something with computers,” Strange said.

Fiona Lewis from Riverside Middle School said she enjoys robotics and believes women should be in the engineering field more often.

“I just think its such a fun thing to be able to work with a team on that sort of thing and I really like building things and stuff,” Lewis said.

The competition continues Sunday for some of the local Vermont teams.
