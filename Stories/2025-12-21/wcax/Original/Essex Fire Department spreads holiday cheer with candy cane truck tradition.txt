ESSEX JUNCTION, Vt. (WCAX) - Christmas tunes filled the streets as the Essex Fire Department continued its annual holiday tradition of distributing candy canes to the community.

Like an ice cream truck in the summer, firefighters rode in their truck playing music and giving out candy canes to residents. The department has maintained this tradition for several years as a way to spread holiday cheer.

Children who received the treats said it was a nice surprise. Bennett and Mason, two local children, said they initially thought it was something else when they heard the music.

“We thought that it was something else but then when we saw it we know it was a fire truck,” they said.

When asked if they knew they would get a candy cane, Bennett said no. Mason said he was happy to receive one.

“We hang it on the tree each year but I decided to eat mine because I was hungry,” Mason said.

The fire department says the tradition is a fun way to connect with the community during the holiday season.
