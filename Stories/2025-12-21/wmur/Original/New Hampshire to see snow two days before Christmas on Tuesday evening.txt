After record warmth melted snow in many parts of the state, New Hampshire is seeing a return to cold conditions and a snow chance before Christmas.

Ahead of the snow, a gusty wind brings in seasonably chilly air for Sunday night.

Monday will be bright, breezy, and very cold with highs in the 20s in many spots.

Two days before Christmas, on Tuesday, New Hampshire will see its next statewide snow chance.

It won't be a big storm, but some snow is definitely on the way for the Granite State on Tuesday.

The snow will likely have an impact on travel conditions, as some slippery spots are likely.
