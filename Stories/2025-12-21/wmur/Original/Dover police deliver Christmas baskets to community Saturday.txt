In Dover on Saturday, employees, friends and family members of the Dover Police Department came together to deliver 150 Christmas baskets to families in need throughout their community.

Each basket was filled with large supplies of food designed to last several days and provide multiple meals for families, including a turkey and other traditional holiday items.

This long-standing program continues because of the generosity of the Dover community and the dedication of those who volunteer their time.

The Dover Police Department thanks the Woodman Park School, Hannaford, Favorite Foods, the Dover Housing Authority and the many others who have donated items to help fill baskets.
