Home Depot stores in Portsmouth and Seabrook was one of 128 locations in nine states that were targeted by a multi-million-dollar theft ring, according to investigators.

New York’s Queens District Attorney’s Office on Thursday announced the indictments of 13 people as part of Operation Self Checkout. The suspects face charges including grand larceny, conspiracy and criminal possession of stolen property.

Members of the theft ring, which was based in Queens, New York, allegedly stole building supplies, power tools, smoke alarms, air conditioners and other goods in 319 documented thefts, investigators said.

In all, the suspects allegedly stole products worth more than $2.2 million over a 13-month period.

“The items were then sold to black market retailers, known as fences, who allegedly ordered specific items to be stolen and then resold those goods to consumers,” investigators wrote in a press release .

The stores hit by the ring include locations in New York, the Home Depot stores in Portsmouth and Seabrook, and other Home Depot stores in seven other states.
