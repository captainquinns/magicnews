Housing Shortage Central to Discussion at Forum in New Hampshire

Organizers of a recent housing forum held at Saint Anselm College highlighted the critical nature of the housing deficit as a primary challenge for New Hampshire's economy. Participants at the annual Housing We Need Forum emphasized the need for ongoing focus on housing concerns. 

The discussions concentrated on innovative approaches to housing development, including updates to zoning regulations and community engagement, supported by the latest research. Organizers noted that adequate housing is essential for a vibrant community.

Manchester's Mayor Jay Ruais indicated that New Hampshire is expected to face a shortfall of 60,000 housing units by 2030. State Senator Keith Murphy from Manchester pointed out that the housing crisis has escalated by 59% in the past four years.

Michael Skelton, the CEO of the Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire, stated that housing remains the foremost issue influencing the state's economic outlook. He remarked on the high demand for housing and acknowledged that it has not been met adequately, creating a significant challenge. Skelton expressed optimism about the future, asserting the necessity for New Hampshire to embrace growth if it aims to sustain a competitive economy, which includes increasing the availability of various types of housing.

He mentioned that while the forum represents progress, collective efforts are essential for improving the situation. Skelton urged community members to advocate for prioritizing housing in local discussions.
