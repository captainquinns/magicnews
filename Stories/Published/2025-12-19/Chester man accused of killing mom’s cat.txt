Chester Man Faces Multiple Charges Including Animal Cruelty

BRATTLEBORO — Gary Clay Jr., a 53-year-old resident of Chester with a lengthy criminal record, appeared in Windham Criminal Court on Tuesday for an arraignment related to various allegations, including animal cruelty and taking game out of season. He has been in custody since December 4, following an incident where he reportedly shot his mother’s cat, Simba, and assaulted his niece.

During the court proceedings, Judge Michael Kainen underscored the severity of the situation by referencing claims that Clay had killed a cat, all while under conditions related to previous felony charges, including aggravated domestic assault. The Deputy State’s Attorney, Johns Congdon, emphasized the risks posed by Clay, noting a history of violence against household members spanning two decades. Concerned for public safety, he urged the court to deny bail pending trial.

The investigation, led by Fish and Game Warden Kyle Isherwood, revealed Clay’s illegal hunting activities, including harvesting two deer without a license this season—one identified as a large doe. Witness accounts indicated that he shot the deer from his vehicle while illuminating it with a flashlight late at night. Following a search warrant, law enforcement uncovered 11 bags of deer meat, alongside evidence that witnesses had been consuming it regularly.

Additionally, the court received statements from individuals involved in the case expressing their profound fear of Clay and concern for their safety. His niece, who suffered from the physical altercation, rated her fear at an extreme level. Clay's criminal history includes five pending felony charges in Windham County, along with various ongoing cases in Rutland and Windsor Counties.

On Wednesday, Clay was charged with an array of offenses, totaling seven counts, which comprise taking big game out of season and cruelty to animals, among others. His public defender requested a timeframe of 60 days to facilitate coordination of his multiple cases statewide. It was also noted that although the state could adjudicate him as a habitual offender, it has not chosen to pursue this option at the present time.
