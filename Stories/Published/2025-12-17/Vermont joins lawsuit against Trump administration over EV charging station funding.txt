Vermont lodges lawsuit against Trump administration for halting EV charging station funds

BURLINGTON, Vt. – The attorney general of Vermont has initiated legal action against the Trump administration for reducing financial support intended for electric vehicle charging stations. 

On Tuesday, Charity Clark, the Attorney General, became part of a coalition consisting of 16 states along with the District of Columbia to challenge the alleged unlawful withholding of over $2 billion designated for two electric vehicle charging initiatives. This group claims that the U.S. Department of Transportation has been unresponsive to requests for new funding tied to these vital infrastructure programs.

The coalition contends that this decision infringes upon the constitutional separation of powers, as funding had been sanctioned by bipartisan majorities in Congress. The lawsuit, which is based in Seattle, represents the most recent chapter in ongoing disputes regarding the allocation of resources for electric vehicle charging networks, funds that the coalition asserts were promised to them under previous legislation signed by President Joe Biden. They accuse the Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration of improperly withholding these funds.
