New Hampshire joins 35 other states in a settlement with Hyundai and Kia related to the rise in car thefts linked to insufficient anti-theft measures in their vehicles. A coalition of attorneys general initiated the lawsuit in response to the alarming number of car thefts nationwide, which has seen tens of thousands of vehicles stolen.

Under the terms of the agreement, Hyundai and Kia will implement software upgrades in all future models and provide complimentary ignition locks for owners of older vehicles. Additionally, the automakers will disburse $4.5 million in restitution to qualifying vehicle owners. The states involved in the settlement will also gain $4.5 million to cover their investigation expenses.

Owners of Hyundai and Kia vehicles can verify their eligibility for these benefits by checking the provided resources.
