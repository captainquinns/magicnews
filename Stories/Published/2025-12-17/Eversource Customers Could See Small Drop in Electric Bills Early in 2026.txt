Title: Eversource Plans Small Reduction in Electric Bills for New Hampshire Customers in Early 2026

Eversource has indicated that residents in New Hampshire might enjoy a slight reduction in their electric bills at the beginning of 2026 due to declines in delivery rates while supply costs remain stable. The utility anticipates that customers will experience this change during January and February, as per their latest projections.

This expected adjustment is part of a series of rate changes filed with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, pending approval. If these adjustments go through, the delivery fees on customer bills would decrease, while the costs associated with energy supply are predicted to remain largely consistent.

For the initial two months of 2026, delivery charges are set to lessen for all customers, with an average reduction estimated at around $2, representing approximately a 2% drop in a typical monthly bill. Simultaneously, in February, the Default Service supply rate is projected to rise slightly from 11.2 cents per kilowatt-hour to 11.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Penni Conner, the Executive Vice President of Customer Experience and Energy Strategy at Eversource, noted that the steadiness in supply costs is particularly reassuring during colder months when electricity usage typically increases. Although delivery rates will decrease, she pointed out that higher energy consumption during winter could still lead to increased bills for customers.

For those using Default Service and consuming about 600 kilowatt-hours per month, Eversource estimates that these changes would lead to an average total bill decrease of about $1.22, which is close to 1% relative to December rates. However, the actual reduction could differ based on individual energy usage and weather conditions.

It's important to note that not every customer will experience the supply-rate increase. Approximately 45% of residential users in New Hampshire currently obtain their electricity through community power programs or alternative suppliers rather than Eversources Default Service, meaning they will not be affected by the supply rate change in February.

To assist customers in understanding their options, Eversource encourages residents to assess their supply choices and compare costs. Additional information about alternative suppliers is available through the New Hampshire Department of Energy, detailing considerations before making a switch.

Moreover, Eversource has highlighted various support and payment initiatives for customers facing challenges with winter energy expenses. These include energy assistance discounts based on income, flexible payment arrangements, budget billing for better monthly budgeting, and incentives for improved energy efficiency. Eligible customers might also be able to take part in the New Start Program, aimed at helping to manage past-due balances through consistent payments.
