Headline: Legal Proceedings Commence Over Market Basket Leadership Dispute

The legal case concerning the Market Basket Board and former CEO Arthur T. Demoulas has officially begun in Delaware on Tuesday. The central issue is whether Demoulas's dismissal by his sisters earlier this year was justified. Demoulas asserts that he was not given a chance to present his side before being let go. 

In this trial, a judge will determine the legality of his exit from the company, a matter that has garnered significant attention due to the ongoing tensions within Market Basket's leadership.
