Title: Development Review Board Denies Demolition Request for Downtown Wilmington Buildings

WILMINGTON — The Development Review Board declined a request to demolish two buildings on East Main Street, citing a lack of necessary information. The properties, owned by Eric Silverstein since 2013, have remained vacant for years and are located within the Historic Design Review District. They are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places and were impacted by Tropical Storm Irene.

Silverstein aimed to prepare the site for a multi-story residential development and has announced his intention to appeal the board's decision. The lack of a site plan and design details contributed to the board's rejection of his proposal. The property at 3 East Main St. endured considerable damage during the 2011 flooding, which has further complicated its potential redevelopment.

Previously, Silverstein obtained approval to build a three-bedroom single-family residence adjacent to the Masonic Lodge. He has made some structural improvements to the 5 East Main St. site since acquiring the properties. However, board members have expressed concern, recalling past incidents where they issued permits for projects that were ultimately left incomplete. This history has led to skepticism about the current demolition plans.

Board member Diane Abate criticized the duration for which the buildings have been neglected, highlighting the negative impact on the town's aesthetics and tax revenue. During discussions, Silverstein expressed frustration over past rejections of his proposals, indicating that previous decisions had diminished the potential viability of the properties.

He emphasized that he would not initiate any demolition until receiving the necessary approvals, stating that hiring architects would be premature without an approved plan. Additionally, Silverstein mentioned the recent HOME Act, suggesting it might allow him to circumvent the Development Review Board in this matter.

While he acknowledged that the proposed project might lead to the loss of historic structures, he maintained that it would ultimately offer a more functional use for the community. He characterized his proposal as a beneficial opportunity for the town.

Town Manager Scott Tucker confirmed that Silverstein submitted an appeal notice to the Vermont Environmental Court, although the case has yet to be added to the court schedule.
