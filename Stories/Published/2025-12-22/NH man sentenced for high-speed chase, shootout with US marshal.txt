NH Man Sentenced to 10 Years Following High-Speed Pursuit and Shootout with U.S. Marshal

BURLINGTON, Vt. - A man from New Hampshire has received a ten-year federal prison sentence related to a high-speed pursuit and subsequent shootout involving a U.S. marshal. Douglas Reynolds, aged 37 and hailing from Dalton, had admitted guilt to charges including assaulting a federal officer with a dangerous weapon.

The legal proceedings were linked to an event occurring in October 2024, during which Reynolds led law enforcement on a high-speed chase exceeding speeds of 100 mph through New Hampshire and into Vermont. The incident escalated when he discharged a revolver at pursuing officers from his vehicle.

In the exchange of gunfire that followed, law enforcement returned fire, striking Reynolds in the head; he managed to survive the encounter. The sentencing took place last week under the authority of U.S. District Judge Christina Reiss.
