Brattleboro Facilities Face Compliance Issues with State Pretreatment Permits

Two industrial sites in Brattleboro have been identified as failing to meet state pretreatment requirements last year but have since taken steps to rectify the situation. 

The Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation disclosed that 17 permit holders were noted for significant compliance failures in 2024, including G.S. Precision and Commonwealth Dairy. G.S. Precision encountered issues related to incomplete sample analysis and was late in submitting reports twice. The company cited employee transitions as a reason for these problems and has introduced measures to remind staff of sampling and reporting duties through its maintenance management system.

Commonwealth Dairy faced challenges by surpassing its biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) limits, and some samples sent for analysis were either too late or did not adhere to required temperature standards, occurring between March and September of 2024. In response, the dairy made improvements by repairing a pump gasket, upgrading its treatment system, hiring more wastewater technicians, and revising its sampling methods.

The purpose of these permits is to protect the Brattleboro wastewater treatment plant from being overwhelmed. Failure to treat waste properly can lead to operational disturbances at the treatment facility. The compliance status of these plants can fluctuate frequently, with reporting delays of about a month. However, the Brattleboro facilities have responded promptly to address their issues.

Brattleboro Public Works Director Dan Tyler noted that while both plants have experienced occasional violations, Commonwealth Dairy has recently made significant upgrades to its pretreatment system, which has positively impacted water quality. He indicated that neither facility has caused the town to breach its state discharge permit, emphasizing their overall good operation despite minor incidents.

Tyler mentioned that industries generating high-strength waste, like G.S. Precision with its metallic content, and Commonwealth Dairy with high levels of organic matter and fats, are often prone to such compliance issues. 

Attempts to contact representatives from G.S. Precision and Commonwealth Dairy were unsuccessful. Other facilities reported for breaching their pretreatment limits include Agri-Mark Inc., Ben & Jerry's, Butternut Mountain Farm, New England Precision, and St. Albans Creamery. A handful of operations also faced penalties for delayed reporting, including several breweries and food producers across Vermont.

The DEC emphasized the importance of collaboration with industrial partners to ensure compliance with environmental regulations, aiming for clear communication and guidance to support facilities in maintaining their permits effectively.
