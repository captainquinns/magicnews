Keene Provides Complimentary Parking for Holiday Shoppers

In an effort to promote shopping in the downtown area during the festive season, Keene will implement free parking starting this week. From Thursday until Christmas Day and again on New Years Day, parking in metered spaces downtown and in surrounding neighborhoods, including Washington, West, and Winter streets along with adjacent side streets, will not incur charges. 

Despite the free parking initiative, the city will maintain enforcement of accessible and reserved parking regulations, along with time restrictions. Additionally, any illegal parking or violations will still result in tickets, as outlined on the citys official website. 

For more information about parking options, residents and visitors can refer to the citys map online.
