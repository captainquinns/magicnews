Headline: Mount Mansfield Covered in Over 5 Feet of Snow, Setting New Record for This Date

The snow depth at Mount Mansfield reached 63 inches on Thursday, significantly exceeding the average of 22 inches for this time of year, as reported by a meteorologist from the National Weather Service in Burlington. Earlier in the week, the snow measurement was 61 inches; however, it decreased slightly due to compaction. 

The meteorologist noted that the snowpack is promising for the early part of the season, but changes are expected as winter progresses. Vermont has experienced heavy snowfall this season, particularly in the northern Green Mountains, where some areas recorded over 3 feet of snow in November.

Jay Peak leads the nation in snowfall among ski resorts, accumulating 192 inches so far, outperforming locations on the West Coast. Other northern Vermont resorts, such as Smugglers Notch and Stowe, have also reported impressive totals, with 116 inches and 108 inches of snow, respectively.

However, rising temperatures anticipated on Thursday may lead to some melting of snow, potentially causing modest increases in river levels. Nonetheless, the meteorologist indicated that flooding is not expected, as the warm spell is likely to be brief and the snow has lower moisture content. 

Travel could become hazardous on Friday, as temperatures are forecasted to drop again, which might lead to icy conditions and additional snowfall.
