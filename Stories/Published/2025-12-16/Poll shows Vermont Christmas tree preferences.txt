Headline: Survey Reveals Christmas Tree Preferences Among Vermonters

The latest survey conducted by the University of New Hampshire has shed light on the Christmas tree choices of residents in Vermont. Approximately 40% of individuals in the state plan to have a real Christmas tree this year, with many appreciating its aesthetic appeal, pleasant aroma, and the traditions associated with it. 

Around one-third of Vermonters prefer artificial trees, with the majority indicating they already own one. Additionally, another third of the population does not chose to have any tree. 

These statistics show a contrast with neighboring New Hampshire, where the findings reveal that only about 25% of people opt for real trees, while over half choose artificial ones. Furthermore, around 20% of New Hampshire residents will not put up a tree this holiday season, with their motivations aligning closely with those of Vermonters.
