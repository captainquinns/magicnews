Brattleboro Dispatcher Faces Assault Charges Involving Family Member

A dispatcher in charge at the Brattleboro Police Department was brought before a judge on Monday, facing allegations of preventing a household member from contacting emergency services. 

Authorities responded to a residence on Kipling Road in Dummerston on Sunday night following claims that Henry Scott, aged 40, had assaulted a relative. Reports indicated that Scott had been consuming alcohol, marijuana, and Adderall throughout the day.

Court filings revealed that Scott allegedly struck the complainant, sprayed her with seltzer, spat at her in the presence of children, and used a sweatshirt to hit her. A representative from the Bennington County States Attorneys Office expressed that Scott's actions were indicative of attempted sexual assault, outlining that he tried to coerce the victim into performing sexual acts in exchange for improved behavior.

The prosecutor further described how Scott allegedly attempted to leverage his role in law enforcement to dissuade the complainant from calling emergency services, claiming he would inform the dispatchers not to respond.

The complainant recounted an incident where she bit Scott when he took her phone, noting that she kept her phone and car keys nearby to prevent him from taking them due to his threats.

Scott opted not to communicate with the responding officers and refused to take a breathalyzer test. Initial charges included domestic assault, hindering access to emergency services, extortion, stalking, attempted sexual assault, and obstruction of justice.

Judge Michael Kainen dismissed the extortion and attempted sexual assault charges, citing a lack of probable cause and remarks that further evidence could be added if the state chose to pursue those claims later.

Scott, represented by a public defender, entered a plea of not guilty. He was released from custody on the condition that he maintain no contact with any witnesses, avoid the residence on Kipling Road, and have supervision during visits with minors.

The town manager, John Potter, noted that he was unable to discuss personnel issues due to confidentiality.
