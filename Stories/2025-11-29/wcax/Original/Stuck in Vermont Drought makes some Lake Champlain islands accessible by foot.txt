BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - This summer’s severe drought caused problems for farmers, people with wells, and boaters. But it also led to some new adventures. As Lake Champlain’s water receded, Vermonters explored islands that were suddenly accessible by foot.

Law Island is a nine-acre nature area west of the Colchester Causeway and is usually accessed by boat. It offers rustic camping sites, windswept bluffs, and a trail that loops around the island. Conserved in 1994 by the Lake Champlain Land Trust, Law Island is now owned and managed by the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.

Seven Days Senior Multimedia Journalist Eva Sollberger joined naturalist educator Teage O‘Connor on a trip to the island in early November for “Stuck in Vermont.”
