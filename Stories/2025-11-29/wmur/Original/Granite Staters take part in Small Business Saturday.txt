It's Small Business Saturday across the country and people across the Granite State went out to get some of their holiday shopping done.

According to the Small Business Administration, there are more than 36 million independent businesses across the country.

Many of those are right here in New Hampshire. News 9 stopped by the Granite State Candy Shoppe as well as the Bookery in Manchester early Saturday.

"It's our Black Friday and we want to make today as exciting as possible for the people who come in and support us," said Garrett Olsen, of the Bookery management team. "We're having so many local authors coming to sell their books, talk to customers, and make connections."

The Bookery also had performances and giveaways for customers today.

Small Business Saturday was started in 2010 to support local businesses during the busy holiday shopping season.
