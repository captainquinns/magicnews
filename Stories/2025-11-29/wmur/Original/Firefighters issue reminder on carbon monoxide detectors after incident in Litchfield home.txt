Litchfield Fire Rescue is reminding Granite Staters to have working carbon monoxide detectors after a 15-year-old was found unconscious inside a home Thursday.

While first responders were assessing the teenager, the home's carbon monoxide meter went off.

The home was evacuated before life-threatening readings were found inside.

Officials believe the source of the leak was from a lawn tractor that had been running in the garage.
