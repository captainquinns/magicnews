There was a fuzzy landing in Manchester today, full of future fuzzy family members.

Pilots to the Rescue is a nonprofit organization that transports at-risk animals from under-resourced shelters and takes them to rescues and adoption centers where they can be cared for.

There were 24 dogs and 11 cats that made the journey today from Florida and then to Georgia, where they were put on a plane to New Hampshire.

“Pilots to the Rescue has been in operation for 10 years, we just had our 10-year anniversary,” said Stephan Nur of Pilots to the Rescue. “We have rescued thousands of animals, our goal this year was about 1,500 lives saved. We have surpassed 2,000."

The adoptable animals will go to Darbster Rescue in Manchester and Toby’s Dream Rescue in Connecticut.
