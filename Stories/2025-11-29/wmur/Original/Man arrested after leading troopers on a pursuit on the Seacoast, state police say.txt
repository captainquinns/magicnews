A Massachusetts man was arrested after leading troopers on a pursuit on Thanksgiving on the Seacoast, state police said.

Mason Hebert, 22, of Boxford, Massachusetts, was arrested and charged with reckless conduct, aggravated driving under the influence and disobeying an officer, authorities said.

New Hampshire State Police said around 10:20 p.m. Thursday, a trooper saw a BMW going more than 120 mph on Interstate 95 in Hampton. The trooper tried to stop the driver, later identified as Hebert, but he did not stop and a pursuit was initiated.

The BMW had the exterior lights turned off, was speeding and driving erratically, state police said. The BMW got off at Exit 5, towards the Portsmouth Traffic Circle, then went south on Route 1, state police said.

The pursuit was terminated for safety concerns and the trooper found the BMW behind a business off Lafayette Road, state police said.

Hebert was the only person in the vehicle. He was led in preventive detention and taken to the Rockingham County Jail. He had a pending appearance in Portsmouth District Court on Friday, state police said.

Anyone with information that may help in the investigation is asked to contact Trooper Cameron Vetter at Cameron.S.Vetter@dos.nh.gov.
