Police say a man broke into his ex-girlfriend's home over the weekend in Hudson and assaulted her and her new partner.

Joshua Deveau, 38, appeared by video in court Monday afternoon on a felony charge of burglary and misdemeanor charges of simple assault, criminal mischief and harassment.

"He was upset that she was with a new boyfriend or a new partner and then assaulted both her and her new partner," said Jered Neff, court liaison officer for the Hudson Police Department.

Police said Deveau shoved the woman and then shoved the man and kicked him in the groin. The man then fell onto a coffee table, breaking it, police said. The alleged victim reportedly showed officers cuts on his elbow and torso.

In court, Deveau spoke to the judge about the possibility of bail.

"I go to work every night, and if I don't have my kids, I go to the gym. And that's what I do with my free time. And then I go home, and I go to bed," he said. "I'm not a threat to anybody. I promise you."

The judge did not grant bail, but she told Deveau his attorney could request a bail hearing.

According to police, Deveau was already out on bail for a charge of witness tampering from a prior case in Manchester.

"It is the same alleged victim in this case as that case up in Manchester, so obviously, we have strong safety concerns, as well," Neff said. "He is acting in a way that puts the victim in that case and now this new case in fear for her safety."

Hudson police said Deveau left the scene of the alleged burglary and was arrested later in Danville.

The judge entered no plea on Deveau's behalf for the felony burglary charge and not guilty pleas for the lesser charges.
