The Nashua Children's Home is working to make sure everyone has a special holiday season.

The nonprofit helps care for children ages 6 to 18 who are unable to stay with their families or attend public schools.

It provides special education services and housing for youth who have aged out of care.

Right now, the youth organization is collecting holiday gifts for the children it serves.

"The donations that we receive off that Christmas wish list really make all the difference on Christmas Day. It brings joy to all of their faces," said Kennedy Dowling, residential director at Nashua Children's Home.

See the Amazon wish list to purchase presents for the children.
