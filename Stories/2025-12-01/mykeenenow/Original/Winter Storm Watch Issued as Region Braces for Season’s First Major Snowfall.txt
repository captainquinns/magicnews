A potentially significant winter storm Tuesday could drop more than six inches of snow and disrupt travel across Maine and New Hampshire.

GRAY, ME (MyKeeneNow) With the region’s first plowable snowfall expected to arrive Tuesday, forecasters are urging residents across Keene and Cheshire County to prepare for hazardous travel and deteriorating conditions.

The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm watch for much of southwestern New Hampshire. Snow is expected to begin Tuesday morning and continue into late Tuesday night, with totals possibly exceeding six inches in many areas.

Road surfaces—especially bridges and overpasses—may become slick early, and visibility could fall sharply during periods of heavy snow and blowing winds. Commuters may encounter difficult travel both in the morning and evening.

Officials recommend avoiding travel when possible. Those who must drive are urged to carry a winter emergency kit containing blankets, water, a shovel, jumper cables, a flashlight, and extra clothing.

The Winter Storm Watch was issued jointly by the National Weather Service offices in Gray, ME, and Albany, N.Y.

In Keene, Public Works crews say they are fully prepared for their first significant storm response of the season. Plow and salt crews will deploy before the snow arrives and remain on duty throughout the event to keep travel routes open.

Residents can help by slowing down, removing objects near the roadway such as trash bins or basketball hoops, and giving plows plenty of space to operate. The city also encourages residents to sign up for parking-ban notifications and check for updates at the Keene Public Works Department website: https://ci.keene.nh.us/public-works .
