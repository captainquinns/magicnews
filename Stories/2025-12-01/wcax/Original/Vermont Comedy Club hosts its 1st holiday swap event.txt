BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - The Vermont Comedy Club held its first holiday swap event, expanding beyond its previous clothing and goods exchanges to offer a wider variety of items at no cost.

The swap featured electronics, home goods, clothes and toys with no restrictions on how much participants could take.

Vermont Comedy Club Events Manager Bonnie Hiliadis said the turnout exceeded expectations.

“We figured people would flow in every once and a while. We had some people at the very beginning drop some stuff off, ran some errands, came back, which is incredible, and then they walked out with more stuff. So, I don’t know, it’s exceeded expectations,” Hiliadis said.

Following the success of the holiday swap, the comedy club plans to host more swap events early next year.

All remaining items will be donated to local sites.
