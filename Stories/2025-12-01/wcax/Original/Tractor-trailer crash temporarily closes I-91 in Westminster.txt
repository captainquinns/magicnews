WESTMINSTER, Vt. (WCAX) - A tractor-trailer crash on Interstate 91 Monday morning temporarily closed the southbound lanes of the highway.

The closure ran from Exit 5 in Westminster to Exit 4 in Putney after the truck crashed into a guardrail at mile marker 19.6.

The roadway has since mostly reopened, though the left southbound lane was closed so crews could repair the guardrail.

We don’t yet have any details on the crash.
