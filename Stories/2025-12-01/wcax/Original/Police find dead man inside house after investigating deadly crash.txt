TOWN OF WADDINGTON, New York (WWNY) - After investigating a deadly crash in the Town of Waddington, police went to driver’s home to make a notification leading police to discover a dead man inside the home.

The crash call happened Sunday at 7:45am when troopers responded to State Route 37.

Police found a silver Buick Enclave off the roadway and say the driver, and only person in the vehicle, was going west on State Route 37 when they lost control, left the road, hit a fence, and came to a rest.

First responders treated the driver at the scene, but the driver later died at Canton-Potsdam Hospital.

Police then went to the victim’s home to make a notification but instead found a man dead inside.

Police say their investigation has led them to believe the driver who died in the crash was injured before the crash and also was hurt because of the crash.

Police say this investigation remains ongoing and believe this to be an isolated incident, and there is no known threat to the community.

An autopsy is scheduled for both people Monday at 9am at Glens Falls Hospital.

At the crash scene, troopers were helped by Lisbon Fire and Rescue, Waddington Fire and Rescue and the St. Lawrence County Sheriff’s Office.

New York State Police Troop B’s Collision Reconstruction Unit responded to the crash scene as well.

Troop B’s Forensic Investigation Unit responded to the home.
