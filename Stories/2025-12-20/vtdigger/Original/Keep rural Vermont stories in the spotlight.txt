Dear Readers,

Some of Vermont’s most important stories begin in its smallest towns. Part of VTDigger’s mission is to surface those stories and make sure the issues shaping rural communities are visible to the entire state.

Because readers support our nonprofit newsroom, we can do that work. There are only 11 days left in our year end member drive. Will you chip in ?

Recently I reported on the revival of freight service into the village of Gilman, where trains are soon expected to travel on tracks that have lain dormant in residents’ backyards for decades. It’s a project with unclear implications for economic change and quality of life, not only in Gilman but in neighboring towns. It’s also exactly the kind of story that requires patient, long-term reporting and a presence on the ground.

As VTDigger’s Northeast Kingdom reporter, I focus on infrastructure, land use, economic pressures, environmental concerns and the creative ways residents are shaping their futures. Your contribution ensures these stories become part of Vermont’s broader understanding of itself.

With less than two weeks left in the year, we still have $327,638 to raise to meet our goal. We’re grateful to the 2,181 members who have already contributed and hope you’ll join them today.

If you can, please make a gift that powers community-based reporting across Vermont.

Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,

K. Fiegenbaum

Northeast Kingdom Reporter, VTDigger
