**Headline: Rutland City Police Chief Announces Early Retirement Amidst Investigation Findings**

Rutland – The Police Commission of Rutland City revealed on Saturday that the city's police chief will retire ahead of schedule. This decision follows the release of findings from an internal affairs investigation that questioned the police department's conduct during a pursuit that culminated in the death of a young officer.

The report came to public notice only when it was presented in court in November, linked to the defense of a Salisbury individual charged with murder in connection with the officer's death. Prior to its disclosure, media reports from sources including VTDigger highlighted concerns surrounding the chief's knowledge of the investigation while failing to inform the commission about its conclusions.

The internal report, which was given to Chief Brian Kilcullen in March, suggested that the tragic death of 19-year-old Rutland City Police Officer Jessica Ebbighausen in 2023 could have been avoided had established procedures been adhered to. The individual involved in the chase, 22-year-old Tate Rheaume, is currently incarcerated without bail as he awaits trial.

After a special meeting, the commission did not specify if the chief’s premature resignation was tied to the delayed communication regarding the report's findings. The commission chair noted that the question should be directed to Kilcullen, who was not present during the announcement.

Matthew Prouty, currently the Police Commander, has been appointed as the interim chief, with Kilcullen providing limited assistance during this transitional period. Prouty will take over operational leadership of the department. Kilcullen's retirement will take effect on March 1, coming after a term that began in 2015, with his latest contract extension set to run until 2027.

The police commission's announcement followed a series of executive sessions held the previous Friday and Saturday.
