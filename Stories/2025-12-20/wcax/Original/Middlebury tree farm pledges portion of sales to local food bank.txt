MIDDLEBURY, Vt. (WCAX) - In the final week before Christmas, a Middlebury Christmas tree farm is donating a portion of every sale to their community.

For every Christmas tree Werner Tree Farm sells, $5 goes to HOPE, a local food shelf in Middlebury.

They also have dropped off free trees at HOPE, so those in need don’t have to worry about the cost. The family says the Middlebury community has always supported them, especially after a tornado damaged their farm in 2021.

“It feels like it’s come full circle kind of and I like to think, you know it feels like it’s the kind of thing that there should be no scorecard and just when you’re able to help someone you do and when you need help you know that people in your community will be there to help you and again when you’re in a position to help you do it,” said Amanda Werner from Werner Tree Farm.

If you still need a tree, Werner Tree Farm will be selling them until Christmas Eve.
