Headline: Dean Kamen Addresses Recently Unveiled Photo with Ghislaine Maxwell

Dean Kamen, a prominent figure from New Hampshire and the inventor of the Segway, is depicted in a new photograph alongside Ghislaine Maxwell, recently surfaced through files released by the Department of Justice. This image appears in connection with documents tied to Maxwell's ongoing criminal case, which also included flight logs indicating that Kamen was a passenger on Jeffrey Epstein's private jet in February 2003.

Despite the associations, Kamen has not faced any allegations of misconduct relating to either Epstein or Maxwell. He heads DEKA Research and Development and clarified his past ties to the situation in a statement provided to local news outlet WMUR. Kamen recalled speaking at the TED Conference multiple times, particularly in February 2002, where he shared rides on the Segway with conference attendees.

In reflecting on the context behind the photograph, he acknowledged the links between Epstein and the TED community over the years, yet reiterated that he does not remember the specific moment captured in the image nor does he have any significant memories involving Maxwell. He expressed regret over his limited interactions with Epstein, emphasizing that they did not involve any wrongdoing on his part. He underscored that his knowledge of the troubling actions associated with Epstein and Maxwell comes entirely from media reports.

Kamen's involvement with Boston's technological landscape and his past as a public speaker has left him in the spotlight, but he remains clear about his lack of involvement in any illegal activities tied to Epstein.
