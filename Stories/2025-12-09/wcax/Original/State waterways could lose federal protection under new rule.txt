BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Waterways across the country could lose federal protections under a recently announced Trump administration proposal.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced the new Waters of the United States rule in November.

It would strip Clean Water Act protections away from waterways that are seasonal or flow intermittently.

Environmentalists say that would put tens of millions of acres of wetlands at risk for pollution or destruction.

It’s the latest move in a yearslong wetland protection tug of war among various presidential administrations.

Vermont Natural Resources Agency Secretary Julie Moore says the rule would have limited reach in the Green Mountains thanks to state wetland protections. However, other states are vulnerable to the changing landscape.

“It creates a lot of confusion in states where they regulate to those federal standards because they’re being sort of whipsawed back and forth as changes are made. We are in the fortunate position of not having that in Vermont,” Moore said. “This significant and ongoing change around the definitions of waters of the U.S. in states where they are trying to follow that federal standard just creates enormous uncertainty for applicants.”

The Environmental Protection Agency is accepting comments on the proposal until Jan. 5.

The Trump administration argues the rule would protect water resources, support the economy, and strengthen the federal government’s relationship with states.
