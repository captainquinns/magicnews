WINOOSKI, Vt. (WCAX) - The Winooski School District has taken down its website amid an online backlash over a Somali flag display.

The school district last week raised the flag in solidarity with the local Somali community after President Trump’s disparaging comments about Somalis in Minnesota.

Conservative social media pages shared a video of the flag along with the school district’s phone number, inciting a wave of messages described by the district as racist and hateful.

To protect the school community, officials took down the district website. The message displayed on the home page references an “unprecedented volume of illegitimate traffic targeting our services.”

The school says it’s coordinating with city and state law enforcement about the messages and is taking steps to ensure the safety and well-being of students and staff.
