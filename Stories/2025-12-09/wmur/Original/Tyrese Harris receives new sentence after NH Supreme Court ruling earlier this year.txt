A new sentence was issued Monday for a Manchester man serving 25 years to life in prison for a deadly road rage shooting in October 2022.

Over the summer, the New Hampshire Supreme Court overturned a falsifying physical evidence conviction against Tyrese Harris.

Investigators had said he fled from the scene and hid a gun, but the weapon was never recovered.

On Monday, Harris was sentenced to three-and-a-half to seven years for reckless conduct.

The judge suspended that sentence until 10 years after Harris' release on his second-degree murder conviction, contingent on good behavior and other conditions.

Dzemal Cardakovic, 45, was killed when Harris shot him on South Willow Street near the Mall of New Hampshire.
