Fire crews in Hudson had to help get a weather balloon out of a tree over the weekend.

A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called for help around 3:15 p.m. Sunday after one of its balloons got caught in the branches of a tree on Glen Drive.

Firefighters brought in a ladder truck, and the instruments were safely recovered and returned to the MIT team, officials said.
