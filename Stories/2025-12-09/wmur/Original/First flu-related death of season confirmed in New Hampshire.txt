New Hampshire has recorded its first flu-related death of the season, even as influenza activity is low across the state.

The flu report for the week ending Nov. 22 from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services showed one influenza-related death this season, a Belknap County adult.

The death came as overall influenza activity in New Hampshire was sporadic.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were an estimated 47 million to 84 million flu cases last year, resulting in millions of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths.

This is the time of year when respiratory illnesses typically increase. The American Lung Association said that from October 2024 through September 2025, there were more than 500,000 hospitalizations due to COVID-19. The organization also said that more than 10,000 older adults die each year due to RSV.

Flu activity is increasing nationally, and the American Lung Association predicts that this flu season might be more severe than usual.

"In New England, the population compared to the rest of the country is older, so by age alone, there's a higher risk," said Dr. David Hill, chairman of the national board of the American Lung Association. "I can say across the region, we're already seeing increased flu and RSV rates of infection, but it's not too late to get vaccinated. It takes about two weeks for these vaccines to reach peak efficacy. And if you get vaccinated today, you're going to be protecting your loved ones around the holidays."

He said the vaccines are a safe and impactful way to avoid getting sick or reduce symptoms.

He also said anyone who's not feeling well should avoid crowds and stay home from work and family gatherings. Regular handwashing can also help prevent the spread of disease.
