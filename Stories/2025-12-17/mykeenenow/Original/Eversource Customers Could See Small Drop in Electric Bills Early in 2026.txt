Eversource says New Hampshire customers may see a modest dip in electric bills early in 2026 as delivery rates fall and supply costs stay steady.

MANCHESTER, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) New Hampshire electric customers served by Eversource may get a bit of relief on their bills at the start of the new year, with company officials projecting a slight decrease in overall costs during January and February.

The anticipated change stems from a series of rate adjustments Eversource has filed with the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission. If approved, the changes would reduce the delivery portion of customer bills, while energy supply costs — often the most unpredictable part of a monthly statement — are expected to remain largely unchanged.

According to the utility, delivery charges for all customers would drop during the first two months of 2026, translating to an average decrease of about $2, or roughly 2%, on a typical bill. At the same time, the Default Service supply rate would edge up slightly in February, from 11.2 cents per kilowatt-hour to 11.3 cents per kilowatt-hour.

Eversource Executive Vice President of Customer Experience and Energy Strategy Penni Conner said the stability in supply costs is welcome news, particularly during winter months when energy use often rises.

“Customers will see the delivery side of their bill go down in January and February, and the supply portion of the bill, which is typically the largest and most volatile due to market forces, is fortunately remaining stable with costs similar to what we saw earlier this year,” Conner said. She added that higher winter usage can still drive bills up, even when rates decline.

For a residential customer on Default Service using about 600 kilowatt-hours per month, Eversource estimates the combined changes would result in an average total bill reduction of about $1.22, or approximately 1%, compared to December. Actual impacts will vary based on energy use and weather conditions.

Not all customers will see the supply-rate change. Nearly 45% of residential customers in New Hampshire now receive electricity through community power programs or alternative suppliers rather than Eversource’s Default Service, meaning the February supply adjustment would not apply to them.

Eversource is also encouraging customers to review their supply options and compare rates. Information about alternative suppliers and what to consider before switching is available through the New Hampshire Department of Energy.

For customers who may struggle with winter energy costs, the utility highlighted several assistance and payment programs. These include income-based electric assistance discounts, flexible payment plans, budget billing to smooth out seasonal fluctuations, and energy-efficiency incentives. Income-eligible customers may also qualify for the New Start Program, which can help reduce past-due balances through consistent, on-time payments.
