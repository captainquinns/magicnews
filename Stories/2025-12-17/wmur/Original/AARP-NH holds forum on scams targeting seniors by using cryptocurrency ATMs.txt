The New Hampshire AARP is warning seniors about scams involving cryptocurrency ATMs.

The nonprofit held a forum Tuesday to discuss recent incidents in which kiosks that convert cash into digital currency were used to steal money.

Advocates are pushing for state-level changes, including daily transaction limits on crypto ATMs.

They said limits would make the machines less appealing to scammers, who have been tricking seniors into depositing large sums.

"And so if there are daily transaction limits, they're basically stopping the bleed,"  said Christina Fitzpatrick of AARP-NH. "You're making sure that people aren't losing tens of thousands of dollars to scammers."

The AARP is also hoping for legislative changes to help seniors recover funds if they are scammed.
