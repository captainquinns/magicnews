A milestone was celebrated Wednesday in a multimillion-dollar project for Manchester schools.

Students and school officials held a topping-off ceremony at Hillside Middle School as it undergoes renovations.

The project is part of a $306 million plan to renovate the city's four middle schools and build a new elementary school. Students and staff members at Hillside can expect a new wing, enhanced security, modern classrooms and more.

"We cannot wait to see the dreams come true at this very special place," said Superintendent Jennifer Chmiel.

Chmiel said the renovations are needed.

"Our buildings are aging, many, many years old," she said. "Seventy years is the average building life at this point in the city. And so, when we can imagine new learning environments and bringing our students into the 21st century, this represents that shift that we're making. We know that we need to have buildings that represent the learning that takes place today."

Students got the chance to sign a new beam before it was put in place. Chmiel said the construction has been an immersive experience for students.

"They've got a mailbox coming that will go back and forth. Students can ask questions, and the construction crew can answer those questions," she said. "We've got a couple of pictures where you can see students look out windows to see the project go up, and we've got students holding signs thanking the construction crew for their work, and you see it really starts to matter."

Another topping-off ceremony will be held Friday at McLaughlin Middle School.
