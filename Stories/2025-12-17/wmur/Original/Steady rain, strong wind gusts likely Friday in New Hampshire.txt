New Hampshire will finally see some mild temperatures for the next few days before a rainy and windy end of the week.

Before we see impact weather on Friday, the Granite State will see its first mild days in what has been a very cold start to December.

For Wednesday, expect partly sunny skies with highs in the 30s and 40s across central and southern parts of the state.

Winds will increase out of the west-northwest late Wednesday evening, with gusts between 15 and 30 mph.

Thursday will bring a mix of sun and clouds, with highs in the lower 40s for many.

Amid the mild stretch, the precipitation expected Friday will mostly fall in the form of rain for New Hampshire, beginning later Thursday night and during the day on Friday.

The winds will also pick up on Friday morning as temperatures spike into the 50s for some, with some southerly gusts up to 40 mph possible. Highs will likely warm above 50 degrees in some spots.

Some areas could see up to an inch of rain.

After the rain winds down in the early afternoon hours of Friday, there will be a sharp drop in temperatures along with gusty winds out of the west/northwest late Friday into Saturday.

The winds could dry out roads before any icy spots form for Friday evening and overnight into early Saturday, but drivers should keep the possibility of slippery travel conditions in mind.

For Saturday, expect fair skies and cooler conditions, with highs in the 30s. A few snow showers are possible Saturday night.

It could be a touch warmer on Sunday, which is the first day of winter. Expect some clouds and partial sun with a chance of a few spotty mixed or snow showers.
