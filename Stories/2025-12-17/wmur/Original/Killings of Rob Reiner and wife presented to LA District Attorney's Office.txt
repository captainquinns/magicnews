Justice for the killings of filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife, photographer Michele Singer Reiner, is now in the hands of the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office.

Their son, 32-year-old Nick Reiner, is in police custody and being held without bail.

He faces two counts of first-degree murder and is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. His defense attorney said he was not medically cleared to appear Tuesday.

Nick Reiner was arrested near the University of Southern California campus, first on the ground and then cuffed by the Los Angeles police with assistance from U.S. Marshals, hours after authorities found his parents' bodies.

ABC News reported that sources said Rob and Nick Reiner got into an argument Saturday at a holiday party. Some reported Nick Reiner was acting strangely.

Rob Reiner was active in Democratic politics. He visited New Hampshire during the 2004 primary to campaign for Howard Dean.

Former WMUR anchor Tom Griffith spoke with Rob Reiner at the 2004 Democratic National Convention about his visit to the Granite State.

"It was great. Had a great time up there. It's retail politics, it's great," Rob Reiner said.

Earlier this month, some of the stars from Stand By Me, a film Rob Reiner directed, attended a screening and Q&A in Concord. Some of the actors posted tributes on social media, describing Rob Reiner as a father figure.
