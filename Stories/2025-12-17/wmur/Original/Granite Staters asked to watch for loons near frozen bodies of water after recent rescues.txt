Granite Staters are being asked to keep an eye out for any loons that appear to be in trouble.

The Loon Preservation Committee said it has responded to multiple reports of loons at risk of getting trapped on frozen lakes and ponds.

They recently rescued two loons -- one on Big Diamond Pond on Stewartstown, the other from Deering Reservoir.

If loons stay on lakes as they freeze, they could get iced into the small patches of open water.
