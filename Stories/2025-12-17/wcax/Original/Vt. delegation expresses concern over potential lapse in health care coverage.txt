BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Vermont’s congressional delegation is warning of dire consequences if health care subsidies lapse for millions of Americans.

Open enrollment for health insurance on Vermont Health Connect runs for another month. But Congress is still grappling with whether to extend the COVID-19-era Affordable Care Act subsidies.

Sen. Peter Welch says letting them lapse would harm Vermonters. “The bottom line here is our failure to act is going to inflict enormous suffering on a lot of Vermont families and small businesses that get their health care for themselves and their families on the exchange,” said Welch, D-Vermont.

Welch says he would support income limits or a co-pay for people to access the subsidies if Republicans agree to extend them.
