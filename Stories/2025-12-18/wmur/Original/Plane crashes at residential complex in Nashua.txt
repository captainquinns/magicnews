A small plane crashed Wednesday afternoon into a residential neighborhood in Nashua.

The plane crashed at a residential complex in the area of Cannongate Road, which is on the other side of Route 101A from Nashua Airport.

The crash happened at about 2:15 p.m., and fire officials said the pilot was the only person on board.

The plane clipped the roof of a home and then crashed upside down near a parking lot.

Fire Chief Steve Buxton said the pilot was able to get out of the plane with the help of bystanders. He was taken to a hospital, and the extent of his injuries was unknown.

No one else was hurt.

Buxton said he believes the pilot was practicing taking off and landing at the airport before the crash.

James Fogarty, one of the good Samaritans who helped pull the pilot from the plane, said he noticed signs of trouble before the crash.

"I knew it was going down because it was sputtering, the engine, and once I got over there, it hit the building, and it flipped upside down. He wasn't really saying much to me. I kinda like backed up once I pulled him away. He had a gash on his head, on the top of his head, probably about 2 inches wide, long, I mean. He was bleeding pretty good," Fogarty said.

The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to be at the crash site soon to take over the investigation.
