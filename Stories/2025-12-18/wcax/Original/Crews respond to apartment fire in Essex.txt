ESSEX, Vt. (WCAX) - A small apartment fire in Essex was extinguished Wednesday evening before spreading to the rest of the building.

Emergency crews responded to an apartment complex on Susie Wilson Road at around 6:30 p.m.

According to the Essex Fire Department, the unit’s sprinkler system had stifled most of the fire by the time crews arrived to put out the rest.

Residents were evacuated from the building as a precaution, and the power was shut off in one wing of the building to avoid electrical damage.

Nobody was injured.
