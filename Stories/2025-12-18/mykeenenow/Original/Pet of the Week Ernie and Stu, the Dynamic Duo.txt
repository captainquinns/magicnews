Ernie and Stu are a bonded pair of male guinea pigs whose playful personalities and strong friendship make them a rewarding match for a patient, gentle home.

SWANZEY, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Ernie, 2 and a half; and Stu, 4 and a half, are an inseparable pair of male guinea pigs whose bond is as strong as their personalities are charming. Originally adopted from Petco at different times, the two quickly connected and have been side by side ever since, giving off unmistakable “odd-couple best friends” energy reminiscent of Carl and Russell from “Up.”

Their previous family cared deeply for them but wanted Ernie and Stu to have more time, attention, and enrichment than they were able to provide. Still undersocialized and not yet comfortable being handled, these small animals will need a patient adopter willing to move at their pace. With gentle care and consistency, they have the potential to build trust and become delightful companions.

Ernie and Stu would do best in a calm home where their social confidence can grow over time. For someone experienced with guinea pigs—or eager to learn—this lovable duo offers double the personality and twice the reward.
