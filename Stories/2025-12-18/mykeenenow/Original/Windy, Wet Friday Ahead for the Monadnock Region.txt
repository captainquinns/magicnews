Strong winds and rain are expected Friday across Keene and the Monadnock Region, with gusts up to 50 mph prompting a Wind Advisory and raising the risk of power outages and difficult travel.

MONADNOCK REGION, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) If Friday feels more like a blustery March day than December, you’re not imagining it.

Friday, Dec. 19 is shaping up to be windy, mild, and wet across Keene and the surrounding area, with rain showers moving through and strong southwest winds picking up as the day goes on. High temperatures are expected to climb into the mid-50s, which is well above normal for this time of year.

The bigger story, though, is the wind.

The National Weather Service has issued a Wind Advisory from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday for Cheshire and Sullivan counties. Southwest winds will range from 10 to 20 mph, with gusts reaching up to 50 mph at times.

Those gusty winds could blow around unsecured outdoor items, snap tree limbs, and potentially knock out power in spots. Officials say a few trees or power lines could come down, and the risk for power outages is higher than usual.

Drivers should also take note — strong winds can make travel tricky, especially for high-profile vehicles like trucks, vans, and SUVs. Extra caution is advised if you’re heading out on the roads.

Rain is expected through much of the day, adding to the messy conditions, before things begin to quiet down later Friday night as the system moves out.

Bottom line: tie down loose items, keep an eye on the trees, and be prepared for a windy, soggy Friday across the Monadnock Region.
