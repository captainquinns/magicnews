Some victims of a fire in Nashua were allowed to pick up their belongings on Wednesday.

The flames broke out early Tuesday morning in the area of Ash and Vine streets.

Witnesses said the flames leapt from an apartment building to an adjacent building that housed music studios, along with thousands of dollars' worth of equipment and rare instruments.

"There are a lot of musicians that are not going to be able to work," said Caleb Dyer, of Nashua. "It's going to be difficult. We are going to have to organize a group to get them here to play with."

Connor Coburn was there when the fire broke out.

"The wind took it over to this building and then after that, it just caught quick," he said.

People who rented space in that building were being allowed back in Wednesday to see what they could save. Coburn was back to salvage what he could.
