A New Hampshire lottery player won a large prize in Monday night's Powerball drawing.

The winning numbers were 5, 18, 26, 47 and 59, while the Powerball number was 1 and the Power Play was 3X.

In New Hampshire, one player matched four out of the five winning numbers and not the Powerball number. The player, who purchased the ticket through the NH iLottery app, paid extra for the Power Play portion of the game, which means his $50,000 prize was tripled, resulting in a $150,000 win.

There was no jackpot winner, but there were three $1 million winners across the country.

The estimated jackpot for Wednesday's drawing is $775 million, the eighth-largest Powerball jackpot in history.
