A Nashua restaurant where several people were shot in September will reopen Thursday, according to Sky Meadow Country Club.

One person was killed and two others were wounded when a gunman opened fire inside the PRIME restaurant at the country club.

Hunter Nadeau was arrested and is facing a charge of second-degree murder.

In a post on social media, the Sky Meadow Country Club said it appreciates the support it has received over the past several months.
