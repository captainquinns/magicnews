MONTPELIER, Vt. (WCAX) - Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday said he supports Vermont Secretary of State Sarah Copeland Hanzas’ decision to refuse federal demands for voter registration data.

The U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday announced a lawsuit against Vermont and several other states for withholding the data.

In August, the federal government asked the state for voter information, including names, addresses, and drivers licenses. Copeland Hanzas, a Democrat, refused and said turning that data over violates Vermont law.

The Republican governor said he agrees that the DOJ’s demands are federal overreach. “I’m supportive of the secretary of state, and this is down in her bailiwick, so to speak, so we’ll see where it goes from here,” Scott said.

The DOJ is suing at least 13 other states over access to the data.
