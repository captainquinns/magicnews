BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - The holiday Makers Market inside Burlington’s Foam Brewers and restaurant Deep City kicked off on Tuesday.

More than 100 people showed up to shop from more than a dozen vendors.

There were all sorts of goodies like clothing, tallow, prints, ceramics and jewelry.

Metalworker Alicia Starkweather says this time of year is really important for local creatives.

“I get to have a lot of customer-facing time. I do a ton of shows around New England, but not so much here in my hometown, so it’s great to be in a place where I can see people and have people have my jewelry,” said Starkweather.

The Makers Market continues for its second and final day on Wednesday from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.
