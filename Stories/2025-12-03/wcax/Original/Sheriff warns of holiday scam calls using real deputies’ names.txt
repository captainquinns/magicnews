PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (WCAX) - The Clinton County Sheriff’s Office is warning residents about scam callers impersonating real deputies to ask for money during the holiday season.

Sheriff Dave Favro said scammers use the names of actual deputies to make their threats and requests seem legitimate.

He said law enforcement will never try to conduct business over the phone.

“My suggestion would be, if you don’t know the person on the other side of the phone, hang it up,” Favro said.

Favro advised residents to call the sheriff’s office if they still aren’t sure about a caller’s legitimacy.
