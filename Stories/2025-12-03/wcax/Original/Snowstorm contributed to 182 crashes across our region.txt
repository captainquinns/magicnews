WATERBURY, Vt. (WCAX) - First responders had a busy day on Tuesday as winter weather caused numerous crashes across Vermont and New Hampshire.

The Vermont State Police say they responded to 90 weather-related crashes statewide. Forty-two of those were in the northern part of the state, and 48 were in the south. Seven of them involved injuries.

In New Hampshire, the state police responded to 92 crashes. Injuries were reported in eight of those. They also helped 152 cars that went off the road.

Authorities say the crashes serve as a reminder to take it slow and not to crowd plows and other vehicles. Also, it’s time to put the snow tires on.
