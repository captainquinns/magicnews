CONCORD, N.H. (WCAX) - New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan wants to hear from people about their experiences with methadone clinics in the Granite State.

She’s launched a community survey asking those who have received treatment at a methadone clinic or who have worked at one to anonymously share their experiences.

The survey responses will be used to inform the work being done to expand access to medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder, which Hassan says is considered the gold standard for opioid addiction treatment, helping people recover and significantly decreasing the likelihood of relapse.
