MILTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Residents in Milton can expect to see a significant police presence near the middle school on Wednesday evening, but officials say there’s no cause for concern.

Police plan to conduct a tactical training exercise at the Milton Middle School from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.

They say there will be a noticeable increase in officers on Herrick Avenue and around the school during the training.

“We wanted to make families aware in advance so you are not alarmed by the activity in the area,” the department said in an email to Milton Town School District families.

They emphasized that this is routine training and not an emergency response.

Many departments conduct regular tactical training exercises to help officers prepare for various scenarios and maintain their skills. The exercises often involve multiple officers and police vehicles, which can create concern among residents who aren’t aware that it is just training.
