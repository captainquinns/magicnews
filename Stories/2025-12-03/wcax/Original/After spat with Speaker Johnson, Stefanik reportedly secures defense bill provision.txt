WASHINGTON, D.C. (WWNY) - Congresswoman Elise Stefanik is running for New York governor, but is also mixing it up with a senior member of her own party.

Stefanik was critical of House Speaker Mike Johnson for initially not putting a provision she wanted in a bill authorizing defense spending.

That provision would require that Congress be notified of counterintelligence investigations into federal candidates.

Her criticism prompted this response from Johnson: “I don’t exactly know why Elise won’t just call me. I texted her yesterday. Um, she’s upset one of her provisions is not being made, I think, into the NDAA. Uh, I explained to her on a text message, uh, as soon as I heard this yesterday, I was campaigning in Tennessee, and I wrote her, and I said, ‘What are you talking about? This hasn’t even made it to my level.’”

On Wednesday, it appeared the two had patched up that disagreement with the measure making it into the bill. However, the Wall Street Journal quotes Stefanik as being strongly critical of Johnson on other matters as well, calling him ineffective.

“Mike Johnson is a political novice and, boy, does it show with the House Republicans underperforming for the first time in the Trump era,” Stefanik is reported as saying.

She also told the Wall Street Journal that if a vote were held tomorrow, House Republicans would not vote to keep Johnson as their speaker.
