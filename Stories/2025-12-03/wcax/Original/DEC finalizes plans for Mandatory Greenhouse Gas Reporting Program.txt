NEW YORK (WBNG) -- Plans for the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program are nearly finalized, according to officials with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, or DEC.

The program would allow state officials to monitor the largest polluters in New York State, and would help the DEC better monitor the State’s progress toward pollution reduction goals.

“DEC’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reporting Program and subsequent data collection is critical to the State’s ongoing efforts to protect our environment and improve the health and quality of life of all New Yorkers,” said DEC Commissioner Amanda Lefton.

Those required to report emissions data include owners of landfills, electricity generation plants, waste-to-energy facilities and other infrastructure that emit 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Lefton said the program will have both environmental and economic benefits.

“The Reporting Rule will enable DEC to collect the information necessary, despite proposed rollbacks on the federal level, and develop effective strategies that reduce harmful air pollution and direct investments where they are most needed,” said Lefton. “This effort will protect New York’s consumers, help to ensure cleaner air and better health, and promote economic competitiveness across the state.”
