The Greater Monadnock Collaborative is leaving its home of 36 years in Keene’s Central Square as it begins a search for a new permanent headquarters.

KEENE, N.H. ( MyKeeneNow ) – The Greater Monadnock Collaborative is preparing to leave its longtime home at 48 Central Square after 36 years, announcing plans to sell the downtown building and relocate to a temporary space on Marlboro Street while it evaluates future options.

GMC President and CEO Julie Schoelzel said the move, effective in January, will allow the regional business organization to better serve members and plan strategically for its next permanent headquarters. The Chamber, formerly the Keene Chamber of Commerce, will open a transitional office at 310 Marlboro Street, where staff will continue to operate and meet with members.

The building at 310 Marlboro Street, originally constructed in 1947 as a paintbrush factory, has housed manufacturing operations, social service groups, and educational organizations over the decades. It has since been redeveloped as “@310,” a business hub that will soon include 57 apartments.

Schoelzel said the temporary move will not impact GMC programming, events, or business support efforts. Instead, she said it gives the organization flexibility to gather community input and determine what the Chamber’s next long-term home should look like.

During the transition, GMC staff plan to hold meetings and “office hours” at member businesses throughout the region to stay engaged with the community.

Schoelzel thanked past and present Chamber leaders, staff, and board members for their stewardship, adding that the relocation marks the start of a new chapter for the organization as it seeks to strengthen its mission and expand its reach.
