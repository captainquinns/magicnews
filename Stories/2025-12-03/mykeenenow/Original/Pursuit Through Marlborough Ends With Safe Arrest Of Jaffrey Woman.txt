A Jaffrey woman was safely arrested after a slow-speed pursuit through Marlborough during a snowstorm, police said.

JAFFREY, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) A Jaffrey woman was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon after a brief, slow-speed pursuit through Marlborough that unfolded during a developing snowstorm, according to local police.

Marlborough officers stopped the woman’s vehicle on Route 124 near Thatcher Hill Road around 4:50 p.m. for a traffic violation. Police said they also had prior information that the 51-year-old driver was the subject of an Involuntary Emergency Admission order, issued out of concern she could harm herself or someone else.

After initially complying, the woman suddenly accelerated away from the stop, prompting officers to initiate a pursuit. With multiple officers on duty because of the storm, police were able to coordinate quickly. A second officer deployed spike strips near the town’s public works garage, deflating all four of the vehicle’s tires less than a mile from where the chase began.

Despite the damage, the woman continued driving at low speeds onto Laurel Street and McKinley Circle before pulling into a driveway and attempting to run. Officers caught her immediately and discovered she was carrying a large fixed-blade knife.

She was transported to Monadnock Community Hospital for mental-health evaluation and later charged with disobeying an officer and resisting arrest. No injuries or property damage were reported aside from the flattened tires.

Dublin Police and Keene Towing and Recovery assisted Marlborough officers at the scene.
