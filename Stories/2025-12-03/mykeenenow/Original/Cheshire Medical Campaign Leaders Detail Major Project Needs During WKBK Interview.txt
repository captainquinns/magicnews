Campaign leaders Rob Therrien and Jane Larmon discussed fundraising progress and major hospital upgrades on WKBK’s morning show Wednesday.

KEENE, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) The leaders of Cheshire Medical Center’s record-setting capital campaign joined Good Morning with Dan Mitchell on WKBK Radio this morning, offering listeners a fresh look at how close the hospital is to meeting its $42 million fundraising goal.

Campaign cochairs Rob Therrien and Jane Larmon — who also hold leadership roles on the Cheshire Health Foundation board — used their Wednesday appearance to outline progress on the initiative, which aims to modernize the hospital’s aging surgical suites and expand cancer-treatment capacity.

The pair told listeners that the campaign has reached roughly $39.7 million, propelled by an anonymous $25 million gift and continued strong community support. The funds will help overhaul operating rooms that haven’t been significantly updated since 1973, allowing the hospital to build six state-of-the-art suites equipped for modern medical technology.

Therrien and Larmon also emphasized the need for a second linear accelerator, noting that Cheshire Medical Center’s existing unit is the most heavily used in New Hampshire. Adding another will prevent treatment delays and reduce long-distance travel for cancer patients in the Monadnock Region.

During the segment, they urged residents to help close the remaining gap by contributing online through Cheshire Medical Center’s website or by contacting the philanthropy department. Five-year pledges, they noted, allow donors to stretch support over time and make larger commitments possible.

Hospital officials have said the full project will cost more than $60 million, with the capital campaign covering a major share of the investment. The upgrades are designed to ensure that local patients can continue receiving advanced care close to home.
