BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - A New Hampshire man involved in a high-speed chase and shootout with a U.S. marshal will spend 10 years in federal prison.

Douglas Reynolds, 37, of Dalton, previously pleaded guilty to federal charges, including assaulting federal law enforcement with a deadly weapon.

The charges stem from an incident in October 2024 when Reynolds led police on a chase in New Hampshire and Vermont at speeds of more than 100 mph. The chase ended when he fired a revolver out of his car at officers.

Officers fired back, hitting Reynolds in the head. He survived.

U.S. District Judge Christina Reiss last week sentenced Reynolds to 10 years behind bars.
