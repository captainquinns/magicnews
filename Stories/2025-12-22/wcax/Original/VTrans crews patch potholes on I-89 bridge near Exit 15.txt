WINOOSKI, Vt. (WCAX) - Potholes are a perpetual problem in Vermont. They’re caused by moisture getting into the cracks of the road and then freezing. While common, they can be dangerous, potentially causing damage or leading to crashes.

Drivers have spotted some big potholes on the Interstate 89 bridge over the Winooski River near Exit 15. VTrans crews patched them up, but officials say staying ahead of them can be a challenge.

“You can’t really predict where they’re going to pop up, unless we’ve already had patches in the area, they know where to look. The crews are pretty vigilant when they’re out there driving and they report back when they’ve spotted a pothole and make a plan to get it filled,” said Dan Shepard, the Northwest District transportation administrator for VTrans.

If you notice a hole that isn’t getting fixed, let VTrans know . And when you’re driving, officials say it’s important to stay vigilant and keep an eye out for puddles or piles of snow that could be hiding potholes.
