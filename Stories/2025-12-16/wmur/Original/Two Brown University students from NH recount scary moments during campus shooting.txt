Two Brown University students from New Hampshire are speaking out after a deadly shooting Saturday on campus.

Two people were killed and nine others were injured when someone opened fire inside the Barus and Holley building.

Shauna, a junior, said she was locked down for about five hours in the science library, which she said is roughly a football field away from where the shooting occurred, before a SWAT team entered the building.

"The lobby was absolutely insane. I was just in shock, because at first we couldn't believe what was going on, and then my next immediate feeling was like terror, like we need to get out of here. We have to go hide, do anything we can," Shauna said. "It's so surreal. You never, you never think it's going to be you until it happens."

Camren Piwnicki, a freshman, said he had just finished a baseball workout and planned to grab his computer and study with teammates at the Barus and Holley building.

Many of Piwnicki's friends were inside the building at the time of the shooting but were able to get out safely.

Piwnicki said his decision to stay in the locker room a few extra minutes may have saved his life.

"It's crazy, because if I didn't choose to procrastinate for 15 minutes and go on my phone, I seriously could have been in the middle of all this," he said. "No one should have to experience this entire thing in general."

Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said no additional press briefings are planned Monday unless there is movement in the investigation.

Authorities released new photos and videos Monday of a person of interest, hoping they will help identify and locate the suspect.
