Two Brown University students were killed Saturday in a shooting inside the Barus and Holley building, which houses the School of Engineering and the physics department.

Officials said the shooter opened fire inside a classroom while final exams were underway.

The victims were identified as Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, a freshman, and Ella Cook, a sophomore.

Umurzokov was a neuroscience major. His roommate, Khimari Manns, remembered him as someone who always made others laugh and was always smiling.

"The loss of him will be felt throughout this community because his soul truly did reverberate throughout the community," Manns said.

Cook was a leader with the College Republicans of America on campus, serving as a vice president of Brown University's chapter. She was also a member of a church community in Birmingham, Alabama.

The College of Republicans of America described Cook as bold, brave and kindhearted.

"She was nothing but peaceful and pleasant. Her loss is really really a big hit for the Brown community," one student said.

Nine other people were injured in the shooting before the gunman fled.

Investigators said the search for the person responsible is ongoing.

Police released new surveillance video Monday showing part of the face of a person of interest. Anyone who recognizes the individual is asked to contact authorities.

The FBI has set up a website and tip line at 401-652-5767 for information related to the shooting.
