For those hitting the road this Christmas season, the national average gas price is expected to be the cheapest it’s been in the last five years.

Gas Buddy predicts the national gas average on Christmas will be $2.79 per gallon, compared to last year’s average of $3.

AAA is forecasting a record number of travelers on the road later this month.

One woman told WMUR that any amount of cut costs helps in this economy.

"I think things have been difficult for a lot of families this holiday season, so if, you know, you see some relief at the gas pump, it’s going to bring a little extra joy to your day and make things a little bit easier to see your family and friends, which is what the holidays are all about,” Suzanne Bellanger said.

Austin Greenfield, a University of North Carolina student who just traveled home for the holidays, said he and his friends had to cancel their holiday travel plans because it was too expensive.

He said with gas prices coming down, he and his classmates won’t have to dread going to the pump.

"Bank accounts are at an all-time low, and it's a big help to me to have the prices low, because this, take 93 and then having to pay more than $4 every time I filled up, it's a really big hit every time," Greenfield said.

Gas Buddy officials advised drivers to take advantage of loyalty programs, watch out for different state taxes, and be sure to drive safely.

According to AAA, drivers will pay the most at the pump in Sullivan County, where gas is an average of $3.02 per gallon.

The cheapest gas in New Hampshire is in Belknap County, where the average is $2.84 per gallon.
