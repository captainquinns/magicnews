BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Whole milk in schools is now one step closer to reality, thanks in part to Vermont Sen. Peter Welch and his Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act .

The bill is headed to the president’s desk after being passed in the House of Representatives.

The bipartisan bill, sponsored by Welch and Kansas’ Republican Sen. Roger Marshall, would allow schools to offer whole milk, in addition to other options like low-fat milk or nondairy alternatives.

Welch says this is a major win for Vermont’s students and farmers.

“Dairy is at the heart of Vermont’s culture and local economy, which is why our bipartisan bill to expand access to whole milk and inclusive alternatives in our schools is a major win for Vermont’s students and farmers,” Welch, D-Vermont, said in a statement on Monday regarding the bill’s passage in the House.
