BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - A former Border Patrol agent has been sentenced to over two years in federal prison for possession of child sex abuse material.

Joshua Hartness, 45, of Colebrook, New Hampshire, was sentenced in Burlington on Monday after previously pleading guilty.

Authorities say in September 2022, Hartness was searched after returning from abroad. Investigators found child sexual abuse materials on his cell phone and online communications between Hartness and young girls.

Hartness has been behind bars since March after he violated his conditions of release by possessing a firearm.

His sentence of 25 months will be followed by 10 years of supervised release.
