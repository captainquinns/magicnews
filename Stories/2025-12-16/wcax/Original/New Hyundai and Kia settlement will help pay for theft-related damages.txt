CONCORD, N.H. (WCAX) - Automakers Hyundai and Kia must offer free repairs to millions of models under a multistate agreement settlement announced Tuesday.

Under the deal, the companies will offer a free repair to all eligible vehicles at a cost that could top $500 million. They must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with an engine immobilizer and pay up to $4.5 million in restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.

The settlement was reached by 35 states, including New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire.

“Hyundai and Kia’s decision to sell vehicles without basic, industry-standard anti-theft technology put consumers and communities at risk and contributed to a nationwide surge in dangerous car thefts,” New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella said in a statement. “This settlement holds the companies accountable and delivers real, meaningful relief for affected consumers by requiring stronger protections, free hardware fixes, and restitution for those harmed.”
