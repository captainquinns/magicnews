BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - A new poll from the University of New Hampshire shows how many Vermonters do and don’t opt for artificial Christmas trees.

About 4 in 10 Vermonters have a real tree this year. The survey says those folks cite the look, smell, and tradition that comes with it.

About a third of Vermonters have an artificial tree. Most of them say they already have one.

Another third don’t have one at all.

Those numbers differ across the eastern border. In New Hampshire, the survey shows that only about a quarter of people have a real tree. More than half will have an artificial one. And about a fifth won’t get one at all.

Their reasons are similar to Vermonters’.
