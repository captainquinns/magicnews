To encourage shopping downtown this holiday season, the city of Keene will offer free parking starting later this week.

Parking in metered spots downtown and in the surrounding areas, including Washington, West and Winter streets and nearby side streets, will be free from Thursday through Christmas and again on New Year’s Day.

During that time, the city will continue to enforce rules for accessible and reserved parking, as well as time limits. Illegal parking and other violations will remain subject to ticketing, according to the city’s website.
