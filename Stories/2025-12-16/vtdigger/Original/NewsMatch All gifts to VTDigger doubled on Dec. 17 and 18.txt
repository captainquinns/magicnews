Dear Readers,

For the next two days, reader support for VTDigger will go twice as far. NewsMatch, a national campaign that invests in independent nonprofit newsrooms, is matching every contribution to VTDigger dollar for dollar up to a total of $24,000.

This match helps ensure that trusted, public-service reporting remains strong and accessible to all Vermonters. Will you help us make the most of this opportunity?

NewsMatch was created to strengthen local news at a time when many communities across the country no longer have access to trusted local news. VTDigger is a trusted information source covering statewide decisions, real-life impacts and on-the-ground developments across Vermont’s 14 counties. But this work takes time and expertise and it is made possible only by readers who choose to support it.

If you have relied on VTDigger’s reporting this year, this is one of the most effective moments to give. Your donation today will be doubled , helping us keep our coverage free to read so every community has access to the facts.

Here is what your matched gift would make possible:

With only two weeks left, we still need to raise $370,410 . Will you make a contribution that will be doubled before midnight on Dec. 18?

Thank you for supporting independent news for Vermont.

Sincerely,

Sky Barsch

CEO, VTDigger
