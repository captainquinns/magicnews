TOWNSHEND — An early-morning fire destroyed a garage and claimed the life of a family dog on Tuesday.

At just after 7:45 a.m., a tone was sounded about a fire at 3896 Route 30. A garage was fully involved in flames and there was a risk of the blaze spreading to the nearby home less than 100 feet away.

Townshend Fire Chief Glen Beattie said the structure was fully involved when he arrived on scene and started defensive operations to keep the fire from spreading. He said the homeowner was able to get more of the pets and family out of the house and to safety.

They did lose a 6-year-old dog that was in the garage during the time of the fire.

Crews work on putting out a garage fire on Route 30 in Townshend on Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025.

Inside the garage was also the main operation facility for Havreluk Tree and Property Management. It was a total loss, with the family losing most of the equipment needed to run their tree removal business.

Beattie said there are two possible causes for the fire, so he's calling the state fire marshal to help with the investigation.

No injuries to the firefighters were reported, but the owner of the property did have a minor burn on his hand.
