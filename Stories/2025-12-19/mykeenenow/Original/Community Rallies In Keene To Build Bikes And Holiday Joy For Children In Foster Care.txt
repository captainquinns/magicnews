More than 30 volunteers gathered in Keene to build bikes and prepare holiday gifts for children in foster care, sparked by a surprise donation.

KEENE, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) A longtime advocate for foster families helped bring some extra joy to local children this holiday season, thanks to an unexpected donation and a strong showing of community support.

Dorrie Masten, owner of The Pourhouse on Central Square in Keene, has been involved with foster parent organizations for more than 15 years. A foster parent herself, Masten and her family fostered children for six years before adopting their son, Ethan, who is now 11. They welcomed him into their home when he was just 5 months old.

Although Masten said she hadn’t organized a large holiday effort in recent years, that changed when a longtime friend visited Keene and asked whether she was still involved with the foster parent community. After learning she was, the friend — who lives in China and was adopted as a child — wrote a check on the spot.

“He said it was important to him because he was adopted,” Masten said.

The donation set a plan in motion to ensure that every child in local foster care would receive a brand-new bicycle for Christmas. Masten went shopping for bikes and brought them to a foster parent holiday event, where each child was able to choose their own.

Those bikes were then delivered to Keene, and Masten put out a call to the community asking for help assembling them. On Thursday evening, more than 30 people gathered at The Pourhouse to build bikes, including customers, friends, families and even strangers who learned about the effort online.

Many brought their children, who eagerly helped with “quality control,” checking over the bikes and making sure everything was just right.

“Each bike was picked out and built specifically for a child,” Masten said, adding that it was an emotional experience for everyone involved. “It was an amazing night. Customers came in, found out what we were doing and cried.”

In addition to bikes, children will also receive other surprises, thanks to extra funds and donated items. Gifts include tablets for younger children, Barbies, soccer balls, sleds, helmets and bike locks for the larger bikes.

All of the completed bikes and gifts will be available for pickup Saturday at the Keene Elks Lodge, where foster parents can collect them for the children in their care.

The effort was coordinated in partnership with longtime foster parent advocates Charlene and Bernie Beaulieu, whom Masten said ran the local chapter of the National Foster Parent Association for years. Masten said she plans to become more involved again, returning to the work she began years ago.

Foster parent associations play a vital role in supporting children and families in care. Groups such as the National Foster Parent Association provide advocacy, training and resources for foster, adoptive and kinship parents, while also connecting families to community support networks.

For Masten, the night was a reminder of what can happen when people come together for a shared purpose.

“It was everything you hope for in a community,” she said.
