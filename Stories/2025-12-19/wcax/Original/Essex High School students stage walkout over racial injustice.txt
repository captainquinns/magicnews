ESSEX JCT., Vt. (WCAX) - Essex High School students staged a walkout Friday to stand against alleged injustice in their community.

Student organizers say “Black and brown voices are not being heard” in the community.

They did not point to one specific incident but a string of allegations.

Administrators told Channel 3 the student organizers were thoughtful in their planning and respectful in their execution. In a statement to WCAX, Principal Donald Van Nostrand says “This event reflects the power of student voice and contributes to our ongoing work as a school community.”
