Some people who live near the self-storage facility where the suspect in the Brown University mass shooting and the killing of an MIT professor was found dead couldn't get home for hours Thursday night.

Some residents said they didn't know what was going on when police told them they couldn't enter the neighborhood.

"He was, like, all I can say is that there's a potentially dangerous situation, and I can't let you down the street," said Kristen Doherty, of Salem.

Doherty and her family live just down the road from where investigators found the Brown shooting suspect, Claudio Neves Valente, 48.

"We were 100% in the dark," Doherty said.

She said her family was coming home from running errands when they were stopped by police.

I talked to the officer. I said, 'I live in the complex, and I'm just trying to get my daughter home,'" Doherty said. "And he said, 'Well, I'm sorry. I can't let you through.'"

Other neighbors said they felt left in the dark.

"I didn't realize what was happening until I turned on the news," another man said.

"It was definitely harrowing not knowing what was going on," Doherty said.

Doherty said her family was grateful to have somewhere to go because they couldn't get back home for hours.

"We turned around, and luckily, my parents live down the street in the unaffected area," she said. "So we went and tried to put my daughter to bed."

She said the family got permission to return home at about 10:30 p.m.

"I don't know how to fix it, but this world needs some fixing," Doherty said. "And it's just terrible that these tragedies are happening so often and so frequently right now."

Doherty said her heart goes out to the Brown University community, and she's hoping for more peaceful times ahead.
