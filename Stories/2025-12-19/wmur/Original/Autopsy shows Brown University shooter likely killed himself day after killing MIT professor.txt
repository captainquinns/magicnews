The autopsy of the suspect in the Brown University mass shooting and the killing of an MIT professor shows that he died of a single gunshot wound to the head.

Investigators found Claudio Neves Valente, 48, dead Thursday night in a Salem storage unit.

His death has been ruled a suicide, and investigators believe he died Tuesday, a day after killing MIT professor Nuno Loureiro in Brookline, Massachusetts. Investigators said Neves Valente rented the unit sometime in November.

Police said Neves Valente opened fire Saturday in Brown's Barus & Holley engineering building, killing two people and injuring nine others.

Neves Valente was a Portuguese national who was a permanent U.S. resident. Investigators said he went to college with Loureiro in Portugal in the 1990s.

Thursday night, officers found Neves Valente's rental car outside the storage facility.

When his body was found, he had two 9mm Glock firearms equipped with green laser sights, five magazines with nearly 200 rounds of ammunition and nearly $900 in cash, according to ABC News. In his car, investigators said they found more ammunition and body armor.

It's unclear where Neves Valente acquired the guns. Nicholas Daugustine, owner of Milford Firearms, said it's likely he bought them in Florida, his last known residence.

"Any handgun has to be purchased in the state that you live in," Daugustine said. "So, if he was from Miami and bought it legally – which I doubt he did – but if he did, he would have had to fill out a background check form, 4473, and he would have had to pass that background check successfully."
