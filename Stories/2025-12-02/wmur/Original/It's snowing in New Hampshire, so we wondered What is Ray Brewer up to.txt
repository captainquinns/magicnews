It's snowing Tuesday in the Granite State, so it's natural to wonder what Ray Brewer is up to.

WMUR caught up with our dear friend today during the first snowstorm of his retirement.

It's part of the first winter season in which Ray will not have to stand out in the early morning cold air.

He said he's happy to be staying in the warmth of his own home for now.

"I've got the fire going. I've got a couple of books," Ray said.

Asked about whether he might return to cover another winter storm, Ray said with a laugh, "I think that's highly unlikely. I think it's time to pass the baton to you and others."

Ray said he's been having a great retirement since leaving News 9 earlier this year .
