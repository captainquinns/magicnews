BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - The construction project for Burlington’s new high school will be completed $6 million under budget.

The superintendent shared the news with the mayor and City Council ahead of their meeting on Monday night.

Voters approved borrowing $165 million for the project, but it will only need $159 million.

“It’s very exciting news to hear that they’re under budget. I continue to talk to BHS students, and they’re extremely excited for the opening of this high school next fall. And for the community, it’s a very important investment for our next generation. It shows great care for our taxpayers and residents. We are fully behind our young people,” said Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, P-Burlington.

Construction is expected to wrap next spring.
