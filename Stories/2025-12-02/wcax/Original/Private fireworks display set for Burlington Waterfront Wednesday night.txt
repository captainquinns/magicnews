BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - People in the Burlington area can expect to see and hear fireworks at the waterfront on Wednesday night as part of a private celebration.

The Burlington Fire Marshal’s Office issued a permit for a fireworks display set to begin at about 8:45 p.m. Wednesday.

The display is being held as part of the Associated General Contractors of Vermont’s annual meeting.

The city now warns residents about such displays after numerous people complained two years ago when an unannounced show caused confusion .

Residents can sign up to get notifications from the city through Burlington Community Connect.
