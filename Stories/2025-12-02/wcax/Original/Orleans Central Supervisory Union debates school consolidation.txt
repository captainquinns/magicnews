ORLEANS COUNTY, Vt. (WCAX) - Orleans students face a major shift as the Orleans Central Supervisory Union district looks to consolidate.

Kindergarten through high school seniors all learning on the same campus-- that’s the potential consolidation plan in Orleans County.

The district says this move could save up to $300 million. That’s because they’d be pouring resources and money into two schools instead of seven.

They want to construct a new K-8 building on the Lake Region Union High School campus.

Superintendent Jackie Ramsay-Tolman argues it would be well worth it for the long-term savings.

“All of our facilities have been determined to need significant work, and that work is ranging anywhere from things that involve safety and security to HVAC systems,” Ramsay-Tolman said.

The district estimates the project would take five years, and the supervisory union’s annual budget would rise by $6 million during that time.

“Right now, the community really is facing this issue of continuing to invest in these older buildings, these older facilities that need millions and millions of dollars of work,” said Ramsay-Tolman.

District officials say class sizes would stay the same and there wouldn’t be large staff reductions.

Still, some students would have to ride the bus for about an hour.
