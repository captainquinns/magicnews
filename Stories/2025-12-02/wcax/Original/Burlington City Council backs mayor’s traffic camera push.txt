BURLINGTON, Vt. (WCAX) - Burlington city councilors endorsed the mayor’s wish for traffic enforcement cameras.

City documents show the mayor’s office wants the Legislature to allow the city to use license plate reader technology to aid in traffic enforcement. We’re told that could mean red-light or speed cameras.

The city would also want safeguards in place to protect personal data so it can’t be used for other purposes.

The Burlington City Council decided to endorse the mayor’s request during Monday night’s meeting.

Some Burlingtonians we spoke to aren’t sold on the idea.

“It feels invasive to be constantly monitoring people as they’re driving. It feels suspicious of a generally law-abiding population,” said Ivan Shadis of Burlington.

The city needs to go to the Legislature for approval because Vermont law generally does not allow the use of cameras for traffic enforcement.
