Rindge police are investigating a string of road-sign vandalisms that pose safety concerns and could leave taxpayers footing replacement costs.

RINDGE, N.H. (MyKeeneNow) Town officials are trying to determine who is behind a recent wave of vandalism that has damaged several traffic signs across Rindge, prompting safety concerns and the likelihood of unexpected replacement costs.

According to a statement on Facebook from the Rindge Police Department, multiple signs — including speed-limit markers and other safety notices — were found defaced in recent days. Because the signs are manufactured with a reflective coating, police said, the graffiti cannot be removed and the hardware must be replaced.

Replacing the damaged markers will come at a significant cost, police noted, and could force the town to redirect funds originally budgeted for other purposes.

Under state law, intentionally damaging public property is considered criminal mischief, an offense that carries potential penalties. Beyond the legal implications, police said the vandalism poses risks to drivers who rely on clearly visible signage.

Investigators are asking anyone who may have seen suspicious activity or has information about the incidents to contact Officer Troy Ashmore at tashmore@rindgenh.gov .
